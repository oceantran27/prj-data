QUESTION -- Floyd Warshall Algorithm


DESCRIPTION -- 
The task is to determine the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices in an edge-weighted directed graph. The graph is provided as an adjacency matrix of size n*n, where Matrix[i][j] represents the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. If Matrix[i][j] equals -1, 
it indicates that there is no direct edge between vertices i and j.

The algorithm works by iterating over each node as an intermediate point between every pair of nodes (i and j). The distance between i and j is updated by comparing the current distance and the path that goes through the intermediate node, using the formula:
matrix[i][j] = min(matrix[i][j], matrix[i][k] + matrix[k][j]).

This method also helps to detect negative cycles. If, after running the algorithm, the distance from a node to itself becomes negative, it indicates the presence of a negative cycle. 

TIME COMPLEXITY -- The time complexity of Floyd-Warshall is O(V^3), where V is the number of vertices.


INPUT --
matrix[][] = { {0, 3, -1, 7},
               {8, 0, 2, -1},
               {5, -1, 0, 1},
               {2, -1, -1, 0} }

OUTPUT -- 
0 3 5 6
5 0 2 3
3 6 0 1
2 5 7 0

EXPLANATION -- 
In this example, the final matrix stores the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes. For instance, matrix[0][3] = 6 indicates that the shortest distance from node 0 to node 3 is 6. Similarly, matrix[2][1] = 8 shows the shortest distance from node 2 to node 1.
In general, matrix[i][j] is storing the shortest distance from node i to j.
