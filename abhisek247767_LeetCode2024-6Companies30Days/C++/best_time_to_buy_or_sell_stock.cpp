Problem statement:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
	



// C++ code for the above approach
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int maxProfit(int prices[], int n)
{
	int buy = prices[0], max_profit = 0;
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {

		// Checking for lower buy value
		if (buy > prices[i])
			buy = prices[i];

		// Checking for higher profit
		else if (prices[i] - buy > max_profit)
			max_profit = prices[i] - buy;
	}
	return max_profit;
}

// Driver Code
int main()
{
	int prices[] = { 7, 1, 5, 6, 4 };
	int n = sizeof(prices) / sizeof(prices[0]);
	int max_profit = maxProfit(prices, n);
	cout << max_profit << endl;
	return 0;
}
