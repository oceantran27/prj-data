/*
    There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n days. On the ith day, 
    the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] 
    the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.

    You decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.

     Given two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.
     
     Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
     Output: 7
