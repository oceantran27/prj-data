## Add 1 to a number represented as linked list


A number N is represented in Linked List such that each digit corresponds to a node in linked list. You need to add 1 to it.

 

Example 1:
```C
Input:
LinkedList: 4->5->6
Output: 457 
```

Example 2:
```C
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3
Output: 124
```
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^1000
