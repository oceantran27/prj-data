## Problem statement
Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.

## Example
```
Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
x = 2
Output: True
Explanation: In above test case N = 3.
The linked list with nodes N = 3 is
given. Then value of x=2 is given which
means last node is connected with xth
node of linked list. Therefore, there
exists a loop.
```
```
Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
x = 0
Output: False
```
