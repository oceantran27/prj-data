## Cyclically rotate an array by one


Given an array, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.

 

Example 1:
```C
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:
5 1 2 3 4
```

Example 2:
```C
Input:
N = 8
A[] = {9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3}
Output:
3 9 8 7 6 4 2 1
```
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1<=N<=10^5
0<=a[i]<=10^5
