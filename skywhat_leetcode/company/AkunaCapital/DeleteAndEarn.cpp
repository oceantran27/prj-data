/*
 Given an array of n integers named elements, we can perform several steps on
 the array. In each step, we choose an elementsi from the array and delete it to
 earn elements i points; However, deleting elements i also deletes any integers
 equal to elements i + 1 and elements i - 1 from elements. For exampls, if
 elements = [1,2,3,4], deleting 2 results in elements becoming [4] and earns us
 2 points.

 Compute the maxPoints function that has one parameter; an array of n integers
 named elements. The function must return a long integer denoting the maximum
 number of points we can earn by performing steps.

 Constraints

 1<= n <= 10 (to the power 5)

 1 <= elements i <= 10 (to the power 5)

 Sample Input : [3,4,2]
 Output : 6

 Explanation:
 Given elements = [3,4,2], we maximize our score by performing the following
 steps:

 Delete 4 to earn 4 points, which also deletes 4 - 1 = 3 and elements becomes
 [2]. Delete 2 to earn 2 points and elements become [] There are no more
 elements to delete, so we can't perform any more steps. The function returns
 the total number of points which is 4 + 2 = 6.
