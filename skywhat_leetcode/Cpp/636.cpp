// Given the running logs of n functions that are executed in a nonpreemptive
// single threaded CPU, find the exclusive time of these functions.
//
// Each function has a unique id, start from 0 to n-1. A function may be called
// recursively or by another function.
//
// A log is a string has this format : function_id:start_or_end:timestamp. For
// example, "0:start:0" means function 0 starts from the very beginning of time
// 0. "0:end:0" means function 0 ends to the very end of time 0.
//
// Exclusive time of a function is defined as the time spent within this
// function, the time spent by calling other functions should not be considered
// as this function's exclusive time. You should return the exclusive time of
// each function sorted by their function id.
//
// Example 1:
// Input:
// n = 2
// logs =
// ["0:start:0",
//  "1:start:2",
//  "1:end:5",
//  "0:end:6"]
// Output:[3, 4]
// Explanation:
// Function 0 starts at time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the
// end of time 1. Now function 0 calls function 1, function 1 starts at time 2,
// executes 4 units of time and end at time 5. Function 0 is running again at
// time 6, and also end at the time 6, thus executes 1 unit of time. So function
// 0 totally execute 2 + 1 = 3 units of time, and function 1 totally execute 4
// units of time. Note: Input logs will be sorted by timestamp, NOT log id. Your
// output should be sorted by function id, which means the 0th element of your
// output corresponds to the exclusive time of function 0. Two functions won't
// start or end at the same time. Functions could be called recursively, and
// will always end. 1 <= n <= 100
