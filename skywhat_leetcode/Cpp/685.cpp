// In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is
// exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this
// node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which
// has no parents.
//
// The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with N
// nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional directed edge
// added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was
// not an edge that already existed.
//
// The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is
// a pair [u, v] that represents a directed edge connecting nodes u and v, where
// u is a parent of child v.
//
// Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted
// tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs
// last in the given 2D-array.
//
// Example 1:
// Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
// Output: [2,3]
// Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
//   1
//  / \
// v   v
// 2-->3
// Example 2:
// Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,1], [1,5]]
// Output: [4,1]
// Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
// 5 <- 1 -> 2
//      ^    |
//      |    v
//      4 <- 3
// Note:
// The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
// Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is
// the size of the input array.
