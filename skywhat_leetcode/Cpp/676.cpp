/*
 Implement a magic directory with buildDict, and search methods.

 For the method buildDict, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to
 build a dictionary.

 For the method search, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify
 exactly one character into another character in this word, the modified word is
 in the dictionary you just built.

 Example 1:
 Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
 Input: search("hello"), Output: False
 Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
 Input: search("hell"), Output: False
 Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False
 Note:
 You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
 For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think
 about highly efficient algorithm after the contest. Please remember to RESET
 your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as static/class
 variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more
 details.
