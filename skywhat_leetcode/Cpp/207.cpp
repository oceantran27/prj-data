/*
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it
possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is
possible. Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take
course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible. Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency
matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented. You may assume that there
are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
