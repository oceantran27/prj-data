# Strange Printer - Step by Step Explanation

This README provides a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm implemented in multiple programming languages (C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go) to solve the "Strange Printer" problem. The goal of the algorithm is to determine the minimum number of turns required for a strange printer to print a given string.

## Problem Overview

The strange printer can only print sequences of the same character in a single turn. The task is to compute the minimum number of turns the printer needs to print the entire string.

### General Approach

1. **Input Length Calculation**: Start by calculating the length of the input string.
2. **DP Table Initialization**: Create a 2D table (DP table) where `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum number of turns required to print the substring `s[i...j]`.
3. **Base Case Handling**: The base case is that a single character always requires exactly 1 turn to print.
4. **DP Table Filling**: Fill the DP table by considering all possible substrings:
   - Initially, assume that printing the last character requires an additional turn.
   - Try to minimize the number of turns by checking if previous occurrences of the current character allow merging print turns.
5. **Final Result**: The minimum number of turns to print the entire string is stored in `dp[0][n-1]`.

## C++ Explanation

1. **String Length**: Calculate the length of the string.
2. **2D Vector Creation**: Initialize a 2D vector to store the minimum turns required for each substring.
3. **Single Character Handling**: For substrings with a single character, set the number of turns to 1.
4. **DP Table Iteration**:
   - For each substring starting from index `i` to `j`, assume the last character requires an additional turn.
   - Optimize by finding previous occurrences of the last character in the substring and attempt to merge the turns.
5. **Result Extraction**: The final result is stored in `dp[0][n-1]`.

## Java Explanation

1. **String Length**: Compute the length of the string.
2. **2D Array Initialization**: Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the minimum turns for the substring `s[i...j]`.
3. **Base Case**: A single character substring always requires 1 turn.
4. **Iterative Filling**:
   - Traverse substrings in reverse order, assuming the last character adds an additional turn.
   - Optimize the number of turns by checking for previous occurrences of the current character.
5. **Final Value**: The minimum number of turns to print the entire string is `dp[0][n-1]`.

## JavaScript Explanation

1. **String Length**: Obtain the length of the string.
2. **2D DP Array Setup**: Create a 2D DP array with dimensions corresponding to the string length.
3. **Single Character Case**: Set the base case where a single character substring requires 1 turn.
4. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - Iterate over all substrings, assuming the last character requires an additional turn.
   - Try to merge turns by finding previous occurrences of the character in the substring.
5. **Retrieve the Result**: The minimum number of turns is found in `dp[0][n-1]`.

## Python Explanation

1. **String Length Calculation**: Start by determining the length of the string `s`.
2. **DP Table Initialization**: Initialize a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum turns for the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
3. **Base Case Handling**: For each single character substring, set the required turns to 1.
4. **DP Table Filling**:
   - Fill the DP table by iterating over possible substrings and assuming an extra turn for the last character.
   - Optimize by checking for previous characters matching the current one to reduce the number of turns.
5. **Final Computation**: The value in `dp[0][n-1]` gives the minimum number of turns required for the entire string.

## Go Explanation

1. **String Length**: Calculate the length of the string.
2. **2D Slice Creation**: Initialize a 2D slice where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum turns required for the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
3. **Base Case Setup**: For each single character substring, set the required turns to 1.
4. **DP Table Completion**:
   - Consider each possible substring and assume the last character requires an additional turn.
   - Optimize the DP table by checking for previous occurrences of the character within the substring to minimize turns.
5. **Final Result**: The minimum number of turns is stored in `dp[0][n-1]`.
