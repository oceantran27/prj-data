# `regionsBySlashes` Problem Solution

The `regionsBySlashes` problem requires us to determine the number of distinct regions formed by slashes (`/` and `\`) in an `n x n` grid. Each cell in the grid can be considered as divided into four triangles (quadrants), and the slashes determine which triangles are connected or separated. This solution uses Union-Find (Disjoint-Set) to efficiently manage and count the regions.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **Initialization**

- **C++**:
  - Initialize a `parent` array for Union-Find, treating each cell as having 4 sub-cells (or triangles).
  - Initialize a `rank` array to optimize the Union operation by keeping the depth of the trees minimal.
- **Java**:
  - Create arrays `parent` and `rank` for the Union-Find structure, similar to the C++ approach.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Set up `parent` and `rank` arrays using JavaScriptâ€™s array functions.
- **Python**:
  - Use list comprehensions to initialize `parent` and `rank` arrays, representing each cell's triangles.
- **Go**:
  - Allocate `parent` and `rank` slices to manage the Union-Find structure.

### 2. **Union-Find Helper Functions**

- **Find Function**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**: Implement the `find` function with path compression, which ensures that all nodes in a path point directly to the root. This optimization speeds up future queries.
- **Union Function**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**: Implement the `unite` (union) function, which merges two sets (triangles) based on their root's rank. This method minimizes the tree height, keeping operations efficient.

### 3. **Iterate Through the Grid**

- **Grid Traversal**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**: Loop through each cell of the grid. For each cell:
    - Determine the base index for the cell's 4 triangles.
    - Retrieve the character (`/`, `\`, or ``) representing the division in the current cell.

### 4. **Union Operations Based on Slashes**

- **Handle `/`**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**:
    - If the cell contains `/`, connect the top-left triangle with the bottom-right triangle, and the top-right triangle with the bottom-left triangle.
- **Handle `\`**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**:
    - If the cell contains `\`, connect the top-left triangle with the top-right triangle, and the bottom-left triangle with the bottom-right triangle.
- **Handle Space ``**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**:
    - If the cell is empty (space), connect all four triangles within the cell.

### 5. **Connect Adjacent Cells**

- **Right Neighbor**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**: If there's a right neighbor cell, connect the right triangle of the current cell with the left triangle of the right neighbor.
- **Bottom Neighbor**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**: If there's a bottom neighbor cell, connect the bottom triangle of the current cell with the top triangle of the bottom neighbor.

### 6. **Count Distinct Regions**

- **Count Regions**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**:
    - Traverse the `parent` array and count how many elements are their own parents. Each such element represents a distinct region.

### 7. **Return the Result**

- **Final Output**:
  - **C++/Java/Python/JavaScript/Go**:
    - Return the total number of distinct regions.
