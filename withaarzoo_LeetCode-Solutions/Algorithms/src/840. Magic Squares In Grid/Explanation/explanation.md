## Step-by-Step Explanation for Magic Squares Code

This section provides a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm for finding 3x3 magic squares in a grid works, using C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go.

## C++ Code Explanation

1. **Grid Dimensions**: The code begins by determining the number of rows and columns in the grid.
2. **Count Initialization**: A counter `count` is initialized to keep track of the number of magic squares found.
3. **Lambda Function Definition**: A lambda function `isMagicSquare` is defined to check if a 3x3 grid is a magic square.
   - **Number Validation**: The function first checks if the numbers in the 3x3 grid are between 1 and 9 and ensures no number is repeated.
   - **Sum Validation**: It then checks if the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal equals 15.
4. **Grid Traversal**: The grid is traversed to check each possible 3x3 subgrid using the `isMagicSquare` function.
5. **Return Count**: Finally, the total count of magic squares found is returned.

## Java Code Explanation

1. **Grid Dimensions**: The number of rows and columns in the grid is calculated.
2. **Count Initialization**: A counter `count` is initialized to keep track of the magic squares.
3. **Grid Traversal**: The code loops through the grid but stops 2 rows and 2 columns before the end to leave space for a 3x3 square.
4. **Magic Square Check**: A helper method `isMagicSquare` is called to check each 3x3 subgrid.
   - **Number Validation**: The method ensures that numbers 1-9 appear exactly once.
   - **Sum Validation**: It checks if the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are all equal to 15.
5. **Return Count**: The total count of magic squares found is returned.

## JavaScript Code Explanation

1. **Grid Dimensions**: The number of rows and columns in the grid is calculated using `grid.length`.
2. **Count Initialization**: A variable `count` is initialized to keep track of the magic squares.
3. **Helper Function**: A helper function `isMagicSquare` is defined to determine if a 3x3 grid is a magic square.
   - **Number Validation**: The function ensures that the numbers in the grid are between 1 and 9, with no duplicates.
   - **Sum Validation**: It checks that the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are 15.
4. **Grid Traversal**: The grid is traversed to check all possible 3x3 subgrids using the `isMagicSquare` function.
5. **Return Count**: The final count of magic squares is returned.

## Python Code Explanation

1. **Helper Function**: A helper function `isMagicSquare` is defined to check if a 3x3 grid is a magic square.
   - **Number Validation**: The function validates that numbers 1-9 appear exactly once.
   - **Sum Validation**: It checks that the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals equal 15.
2. **Grid Dimensions**: The number of rows and columns in the grid is determined.
3. **Count Initialization**: A counter `count` is initialized to track the number of magic squares.
4. **Grid Traversal**: The grid is traversed, and each possible 3x3 subgrid is checked using `isMagicSquare`.
5. **Return Count**: The total count of magic squares found is returned.

## Go Code Explanation

1. **Grid Dimensions**: The number of rows and columns in the grid is determined.
2. **Count Initialization**: A counter `count` is initialized to track the magic squares found.
3. **Magic Square Check**: A function `isMagicSquare` is defined to validate a 3x3 subgrid.
   - **Number Validation**: It checks that numbers 1-9 appear exactly once and are within the valid range.
   - **Sum Validation**: It verifies that the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals are 15.
4. **Grid Traversal**: The grid is looped through to check every possible 3x3 subgrid using the `isMagicSquare` function.
5. **Return Count**: The final count of magic squares found is returned.
