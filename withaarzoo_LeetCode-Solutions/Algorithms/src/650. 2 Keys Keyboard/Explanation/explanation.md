## C++ Code Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start by initializing a variable `operations` to zero. This will keep track of the total number of operations needed to achieve the target number of 'A's.

2. **Iterating through Possible Factors:**
   - Begin a loop from `2` up to `n`, as `1` is not a valid factor for this problem.

3. **Checking Divisibility:**
   - Inside the loop, continuously check if `n` is divisible by the current number `i`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it means `i` is a factor of `n`.

4. **Counting Operations:**
   - Each time `n` is divisible by `i`, add `i` to `operations`, simulating the sequence of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations required.

5. **Updating `n`:**
   - After counting the operations, divide `n` by `i` to reduce `n` for the next iteration.

6. **Completion:**
   - Continue this process until `n` is fully factorized, and then return the total number of operations needed.

## Java Code Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an integer variable `operations` and set it to zero. This will accumulate the number of operations needed.

2. **Loop Through Factors:**
   - Start a loop with `i` beginning at `2` and continuing up to `n`. The loop checks for possible divisors of `n`.

3. **Check and Divide:**
   - Within the loop, use a while loop to continuously check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If true, it means that `i` is a factor, and `n` can be reduced by dividing it by `i`.

4. **Accumulate Operations:**
   - Each successful division adds the divisor `i` to the `operations` variable, representing the number of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - After `n` has been completely factorized, return the accumulated `operations` as the final result.

## JavaScript Code Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Begin by setting a variable `operations` to zero. This will be used to tally up the number of steps needed.

2. **Loop to Find Factors:**
   - Start a loop from `2` up to `n`, since `1` is not a valid divisor in this problem.

3. **Divisibility Check:**
   - Inside the loop, continuously check if `n` is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, then `i` is a valid factor.

4. **Count Operations:**
   - Every time `n` is divisible by `i`, add `i` to `operations` to represent the required operations.

5. **Update `n`:**
   - Reduce `n` by dividing it by `i` and continue until `n` is fully divided.

6. **Final Return:**
   - After completing the loop, return the total count of `operations`.

## Python Code Explanation

1. **Set Up:**
   - Initialize `operations` to zero. This variable will track the minimum number of operations required.

2. **Loop Through Possible Divisors:**
   - Start with `i` equal to `2`, and loop until `i` is greater than `n`. This loop finds the smallest factors of `n`.

3. **Factorization and Counting:**
   - For each `i`, while `n` is divisible by `i`, keep adding `i` to `operations` to represent the steps taken.

4. **Reduce and Continue:**
   - Divide `n` by `i` after each successful factorization to move towards the final result.

5. **Return the Total Operations:**
   - Once the loop completes, return the `operations` value which represents the total steps needed.

## Go Code Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Declare an `operations` variable and set it to zero. This will accumulate the number of operations needed.

2. **Factorization Loop:**
   - Start a loop from `2` to `n`, checking for factors of `n`.

3. **Divisibility and Counting:**
   - Inside the loop, while `n` is divisible by `i`, add `i` to `operations` to account for each division operation.

4. **Update `n`:**
   - After adding to `operations`, divide `n` by `i` to reduce it for the next possible factor.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Continue the process until `n` is fully divided. Then, return the `operations` as the result.
