# Maximal Score After Applying K Operations - Step-by-Step Explanation

## Problem Overview

We need to maximize the score by choosing elements from the array and updating them by applying the `ceil(num[i] / 3)` operation exactly `k` times.

## General Approach

1. **Use a Priority Queue or Max-Heap:** To always select the largest element available, use a max-heap to keep track of the maximum elements efficiently.
2. **Maximize the Score:** Each time, extract the largest element, add it to the score, and then reduce the element using `ceil(num[i] / 3)` before pushing it back into the heap.
3. **Repeat the Process:** Repeat this operation exactly `k` times and return the total score.

## C++ Code Explanation

1. **Step 1:** Start by importing necessary headers for the priority queue.
2. **Step 2:** Convert the input array into a max-heap using a priority queue.
3. **Step 3:** Set up a loop to perform exactly `k` operations. During each iteration:
   - Extract the maximum value.
   - Add it to the score.
   - Update the value by dividing it by 3 and pushing it back into the heap.
4. **Step 4:** Once the loop finishes, return the accumulated score as the result.

## Java Code Explanation

1. **Step 1:** Import relevant libraries such as `PriorityQueue` for handling the heap.
2. **Step 2:** Initialize a max-heap using the `PriorityQueue` by inserting all the elements in a reverse order (to simulate a max-heap).
3. **Step 3:** For each of the `k` operations:
   - Poll the maximum element from the queue.
   - Add the polled element to the score.
   - Compute the new value by dividing it by 3 and push it back into the queue.
4. **Step 4:** After performing `k` operations, return the total score as the answer.

## JavaScript Code Explanation

1. **Step 1:** Start by initializing a max-heap using an array and a custom comparator function to handle the maximum extraction.
2. **Step 2:** Push all elements of the array into the heap.
3. **Step 3:** For `k` iterations, perform the following steps:
   - Pop the largest element from the heap.
   - Add this element to the score.
   - Calculate its new value (after dividing by 3) and push it back to the heap.
4. **Step 4:** After completing the iterations, return the accumulated score.

## Python Code Explanation

1. **Step 1:** Use Python’s `heapq` library to implement a max-heap by pushing negative values.
2. **Step 2:** Insert all elements of the array into the max-heap (negating them to simulate max behavior).
3. **Step 3:** For each of the `k` steps:
   - Pop the largest (most negative) element.
   - Add its absolute value to the score.
   - Compute the new value by dividing the element by 3 and push it back into the heap (still negative).
4. **Step 4:** After `k` iterations, return the total score.

## Go Code Explanation

1. **Step 1:** Import necessary packages including `container/heap` to simulate the priority queue (max-heap).
2. **Step 2:** Push all elements of the array into a custom max-heap.
3. **Step 3:** For each operation (up to `k` times):
   - Pop the largest element from the heap.
   - Add this element to the score.
   - Recalculate the element’s value (divide by 3) and push it back into the heap.
4. **Step 4:** After processing the `k` operations, return the total score.

## Conclusion

In all implementations, the core logic revolves around efficiently selecting the largest element using a heap, modifying it, and repeating this process `k` times to maximize the score. Each language uses its own syntax and heap handling mechanisms, but the overall approach remains consistent.
