# Counting Seniors: Step-by-Step Explanation

This README provides a detailed explanation of the code implementations in different programming languages to count the number of seniors (people aged over 60) from a list of strings containing personal details. Below are the step-by-step explanations for each language:

## C++

1. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Start by initializing a variable `count` to zero. This will keep track of the number of seniors.

2. **Iterate Through the List:**
   - Use a loop to iterate through each string in the `details` vector.

3. **Extract Age Substring:**
   - Extract a substring from each detail string, assuming the age is located at specific positions (11 and 12).

4. **Convert to Integer:**
   - Convert the extracted substring to an integer to get the person's age.

5. **Check for Seniors:**
   - Check if the extracted age is greater than 60. If true, increment the `count`.

6. **Return the Count:**
   - After the loop, return the total count of seniors.

## Java

1. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Declare and initialize an integer `count` to zero.

2. **Loop Through the Details:**
   - Use a for-each loop to go through each string in the `details` array.

3. **Extract Age Substring:**
   - Use `substring()` method to extract the age portion from each detail string.

4. **Convert to Integer:**
   - Convert the substring to an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`.

5. **Check and Count Seniors:**
   - If the age is greater than 60, increment the `count`.

6. **Return Result:**
   - Return the `count` variable, representing the number of seniors.

## JavaScript

1. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Initialize a variable `count` to zero to store the number of seniors.

2. **Iterate Over Details:**
   - Use a for-loop or for-of loop to iterate through each string in the `details` array.

3. **Extract Age:**
   - Extract the age substring using the `substring()` method.

4. **Convert to Integer:**
   - Convert the substring to an integer using `parseInt()`.

5. **Check Age Condition:**
   - Check if the age is greater than 60. If true, increment `count`.

6. **Return the Count:**
   - Return the total `count` after processing all details.

## Python

1. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Start with `count = 0` to keep track of the seniors.

2. **Loop Through Details:**
   - Iterate over each string in the `details` list.

3. **Extract and Convert Age:**
   - Extract the age substring and convert it to an integer.

4. **Check if Senior:**
   - If the age is over 60, increase the `count` by 1.

5. **Return the Total Count:**
   - After the loop, return the `count`.

## Go

1. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Define `count` as 0 to count the number of seniors.

2. **Iterate Over Details:**
   - Use a loop to go through each string in the `details` slice.

3. **Extract Age Substring:**
   - Extract the substring containing the age using slicing.

4. **Convert Age:**
   - Convert the age substring to an integer using `strconv.Atoi()`.

5. **Check Age Condition:**
   - If the age is greater than 60, increment `count`.

6. **Return Result:**
   - Return the `count` variable containing the total number of seniors.

These steps ensure that the code correctly identifies and counts individuals who are over 60 years old based on the provided details. The consistent logic across all languages highlights the importance of data extraction, conversion, and conditional checks in solving this problem.
