# Minimum Height Shelves Solution

## Introduction

This README explains the implementation of a solution to find the minimum height required to place all books on a bookshelf with a fixed width. The solution uses dynamic programming to optimize the placement of books on shelves. Below are detailed step-by-step explanations for implementations in C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go.

### C++ Implementation

1. **Initialization**: Define a class `Solution` with a public method `minHeightShelves`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Create a vector `dp` to store the minimum height required to place the first `i` books. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 (base case) and others to `INT_MAX`.
3. **Iterate Through Books**: Use a nested loop to consider each book and try placing it on the current shelf.
   - **Shelf Parameters**: Track the current shelf's width and height.
   - **Check Feasibility**: For each possible starting book, add its width and check if it exceeds the shelf width. If it does, break the loop.
   - **Update Shelf Height**: Determine the maximum height for the current shelf.
   - **Update DP Array**: Update `dp[i]` with the minimum value of its current value and the new calculated height.
4. **Result**: The last value in `dp` will give the minimum height required for all books.

### Java Implementation

1. **Initialization**: Define a class `Solution` with a public method `minHeightShelves`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Create an integer array `dp` to store the minimum height for the first `i` books. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 and others to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
3. **Iterate Through Books**: Use a nested loop to consider each book and try placing it on the current shelf.
   - **Shelf Parameters**: Track the current shelf's width and height.
   - **Check Feasibility**: For each book, add its width and check if it exceeds the shelf width. If so, break the loop.
   - **Update Shelf Height**: Determine the maximum height for the current shelf.
   - **Update DP Array**: Update `dp[i]` with the minimum value of its current value and the new calculated height.
4. **Result**: The last value in `dp` will give the minimum height required for all books.

### JavaScript Implementation

1. **Function Definition**: Define a function `minHeightShelves` that accepts `books` and `shelfWidth` as parameters.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Initialize an array `dp` with `Infinity`, setting `dp[0]` to 0.
3. **Iterate Through Books**: Use a nested loop to iterate over each book and try placing it on the current shelf.
   - **Shelf Parameters**: Track the current shelf's width and height.
   - **Check Feasibility**: For each book, add its width and check if it exceeds the shelf width. If it does, break the loop.
   - **Update Shelf Height**: Determine the maximum height for the current shelf.
   - **Update DP Array**: Update `dp[i]` with the minimum value of its current value and the new calculated height.
4. **Result**: The last value in `dp` will give the minimum height required for all books.

### Python Implementation

1. **Class Definition**: Define a class `Solution` with a method `minHeightShelves`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Create a list `dp` initialized with `float('inf')`, setting `dp[0]` to 0.
3. **Iterate Through Books**: Use a nested loop to iterate over each book and try placing it on the current shelf.
   - **Shelf Parameters**: Track the current shelf's width and height.
   - **Check Feasibility**: For each book, add its width and check if it exceeds the shelf width. If it does, break the loop.
   - **Update Shelf Height**: Determine the maximum height for the current shelf.
   - **Update DP Array**: Update `dp[i]` with the minimum value of its current value and the new calculated height.
4. **Result**: The last value in `dp` will give the minimum height required for all books.

### Go Implementation

1. **Function Definition**: Define a function `minHeightShelves` that accepts `books` and `shelfWidth`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Initialize an array `dp` with `1<<31 - 1` (representing infinity), setting `dp[0]` to 0.
3. **Iterate Through Books**: Use a nested loop to iterate over each book and try placing it on the current shelf.
   - **Shelf Parameters**: Track the current shelf's width and height.
   - **Check Feasibility**: For each book, add its width and check if it exceeds the shelf width. If it does, break the loop.
   - **Update Shelf Height**: Determine the maximum height for the current shelf.
   - **Update DP Array**: Update `dp[i]` with the minimum value of its current value and the new calculated height.
4. **Result**: The last value in `dp` will give the minimum height required for all books.

These implementations provide an efficient way to calculate the minimum height required to store books on a bookshelf with a fixed width. The use of dynamic programming helps optimize the solution by storing intermediate results, reducing the need for redundant calculations.
