# Longest Common Prefix Between Two Arrays - Explanation

## Problem Statement

Given two arrays of integers, find the length of the longest common prefix between any number from the first array (`arr1`) and any number from the second array (`arr2`). A "prefix" is defined as the initial characters of a number when represented as a string.

## C++ Code Explanation

1. **Prefix Storage:**
   - An unordered map (`prefixMap`) is used to store the prefixes of the numbers from the first array (`arr1`).

2. **Building the Prefix Map:**
   - Convert each number from `arr1` to a string.
   - Extract prefixes by incrementally appending characters (digits) from the string representation of each number.
   - Store each prefix in the map and count its occurrences.

3. **Checking Prefixes in the Second Array:**
   - For each number in `arr2`, convert it to a string.
   - Build prefixes similarly to how it was done for `arr1`.
   - Check if any of these prefixes exist in the map from `arr1`. If found, update the maximum common prefix length.

4. **Result:**
   - Return the maximum length of the common prefix found between `arr1` and `arr2`.

## Java Code Explanation

1. **Using a HashMap:**
   - A `HashMap` is used to store the prefixes of the numbers from the first array (`arr1`).

2. **Storing Prefixes from `arr1`:**
   - Convert each number from `arr1` into a string.
   - Generate all possible prefixes by iterating over the string representation of the number and store them in the `HashMap`.
   - Each prefix is stored with its count (or incremented if it already exists).

3. **Searching in `arr2`:**
   - For each number in `arr2`, generate its prefixes by converting the number to a string.
   - Check if any prefix exists in the `HashMap` from `arr1`. Update the maximum common prefix length if found.

4. **Final Step:**
   - Return the longest common prefix length found.

## JavaScript Code Explanation

1. **Prefix Map:**
   - A `Map` is used to store the prefixes of the numbers from `arr1`.

2. **Prefix Generation for `arr1`:**
   - Convert each number in `arr1` to a string.
   - For each character (digit) in the string, append it to the growing prefix.
   - Add each prefix to the `Map` and increment its count if it already exists.

3. **Check for Common Prefixes in `arr2`:**
   - For each number in `arr2`, convert it to a string and generate its prefixes.
   - Check if any of these prefixes exist in the `Map`. If found, update the length of the longest common prefix.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the maximum length of the common prefix found between `arr1` and `arr2`.

## Python Code Explanation

1. **Prefix Dictionary:**
   - A dictionary (`prefix_map`) is used to store prefixes of numbers from `arr1`.

2. **Building the Prefix Map:**
   - Convert each number from `arr1` to a string.
   - Incrementally build prefixes by iterating through each character of the string.
   - Store the prefixes in the dictionary and count their occurrences.

3. **Check for Common Prefixes in `arr2`:**
   - For each number in `arr2`, convert it to a string and generate prefixes.
   - Check if these prefixes exist in the dictionary from `arr1` and update the longest common prefix length accordingly.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Return the length of the longest common prefix found.

## Go Code Explanation

1. **Prefix Map:**
   - A map (`prefixMap`) is used to store prefixes of numbers from `arr1` along with their counts.

2. **Building Prefixes for `arr1`:**
   - Convert each number from `arr1` to a string.
   - Incrementally build prefixes by iterating over the string.
   - Store these prefixes in the map and count their occurrences.

3. **Checking Prefixes in `arr2`:**
   - Convert each number from `arr2` to a string and generate prefixes similarly.
   - Check if these prefixes exist in the `prefixMap`. If found, update the longest common prefix length.

4. **Return Result:**
   - The function returns the maximum length of the common prefix between the two arrays.

In summary, each language implements the same core algorithm:

1. **Build a map** of prefixes from the first array.
2. **Check for common prefixes** in the second array.
3. **Track and return** the longest common prefix length found.
