# Minimum Days to Disconnect a Grid: Step-by-Step Explanation

This README provides a step-by-step explanation of how the C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python implementations of the "Minimum Days to Disconnect a Grid" problem work. Each explanation is broken down into logical steps without showing the actual code, allowing you to understand the thought process behind each solution.

## **C++ Code Explanation**

### 1. **Initial Check**

- **Check if Grid is Already Disconnected**:
  - Begin by checking if the grid is already disconnected, meaning there are separate landmasses. If so, return `0` days, as no action is needed.

### 2. **Remove One Cell at a Time**

- **Iterate Over the Grid**:
  - Traverse each cell in the grid. If the cell contains land (`1`), temporarily change it to water (`0`).
- **Check for Disconnection**:
  - After making the change, check if the grid has become disconnected. If it has, return `1` day, as only one removal is necessary.
- **Revert the Change**:
  - If the grid remains connected, revert the cell back to land (`1`) and continue checking other cells.

### 3. **Remove Two Cells at a Time**

- **Nested Iteration**:
  - If removing a single cell doesn’t work, try removing two cells. For each land cell, temporarily remove it and then try removing another land cell.
- **Check for Disconnection**:
  - After each removal, check if the grid is disconnected. If it becomes disconnected, return `2` days.
- **Revert Both Changes**:
  - If the grid remains connected, revert both cells back to land.

### 4. **Return 2 Days by Default**

- **Final Return**:
  - If no disconnection occurs after trying to remove up to two cells, return `2` days as the grid can only be disconnected by removing at least two cells.

### 5. **Helper Functions**

- **Check Disconnection**:
  - This function checks if the grid is disconnected by counting separate landmasses.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - BFS is used to explore all connected land cells from a starting point.

## **Java Code Explanation**

### 1. **Initial Check**

- **Check if Grid is Already Disconnected**:
  - Begin by checking if the grid is already disconnected. If it is, return `0` days.

### 2. **Remove One Land Cell**

- **Iterate Over Each Cell**:
  - Traverse each cell in the grid. If the cell is land (`1`), temporarily change it to water (`0`).
- **Check for Disconnection**:
  - Check if the grid is now disconnected. If so, return `1` day.
- **Revert Change**:
  - If the grid is still connected, revert the cell back to land.

### 3. **Remove Two Land Cells**

- **Try Removing Two Cells**:
  - If removing a single cell doesn’t work, try removing two cells sequentially. For each land cell, temporarily change it to water, then try removing another cell.
- **Check for Disconnection**:
  - After removing the second cell, check if the grid is disconnected. If it is, return `2` days.
- **Revert Changes**:
  - If no disconnection occurs, revert both cells back to land.

### 4. **Return 2 Days by Default**

- **Final Return**:
  - If no solution is found after trying to remove up to two cells, return `2` days as the default answer.

### 5. **Helper Methods**

- **Check Disconnection**:
  - This method checks if the grid is disconnected by identifying separate landmasses.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - BFS is used to explore all connected land cells, starting from a given cell.

## **JavaScript Code Explanation**

### 1. **Initial Check**

- **Check for Initial Disconnection**:
  - First, check if the grid is already disconnected. If so, return `0` days, as no changes are needed.

### 2. **Remove One Land Cell**

- **Iterate Through Each Cell**:
  - Loop through each cell in the grid. If the cell is land (`1`), temporarily turn it into water (`0`).
- **Disconnection Check**:
  - Check if the grid is disconnected after the change. If it is, return `1` day.
- **Revert Change**:
  - If the grid remains connected, revert the cell back to land.

### 3. **Remove Two Land Cells**

- **Nested Loop for Two Removals**:
  - If removing one cell doesn't work, attempt to remove two cells. For each land cell, temporarily turn it into water, and then try removing another land cell.
- **Check for Disconnection**:
  - After both removals, check if the grid is disconnected. If it is, return `2` days.
- **Revert Both Changes**:
  - If the grid is still connected, revert both cells back to land.

### 4. **Return 2 Days by Default**

- **Final Return**:
  - If no solution is found after trying to remove up to two cells, return `2` days as the answer.

### 5. **Helper Functions**

- **Check Disconnection**:
  - This function checks if the grid is disconnected by identifying separate landmasses.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - BFS is used to explore all connected land cells, beginning from a starting cell.

- **Check for Disconnection**:
  - After removing both cells, check if the grid is disconnected. If it is, return `2` days.

## **Go Code Explanation**

1. **Define the Function Signature**:
   - Start by defining the main function that takes an integer input representing the number of oranges.
   - The function returns the minimum number of days required to eat all the oranges.

2. **Base Case Check**:
   - Implement a base case that immediately returns the number of days when the orange count is small (e.g., `n <= 1`). This handles the simplest scenarios without further computation.

3. **Memoization Setup**:
   - Use a map or dictionary to store previously computed results for specific numbers of oranges. This helps in reducing redundant calculations by caching results.

4. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - For the main logic, consider two primary cases:
     - **Divisible by 2**: Calculate the number of days required if the oranges are divisible by 2.
     - **Divisible by 3**: Similarly, calculate the days required if the oranges are divisible by 3.
   - In both cases, use the previously stored results in the map to avoid redundant calculations.

5. **Choose the Minimum Days**:
   - From the possible scenarios, select the one that takes the minimum number of days.
   - Add 1 to account for the current day of the operation.

6. **Store the Result**:
   - Store the result in the map for future reference, thus making the solution efficient.

7. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, return the minimum number of days required, as calculated.
