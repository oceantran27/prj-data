# MyCalendar Booking System - Step-by-Step Explanation

## C++ Code

1. **Class Definition:**
   - The class `MyCalendar` is defined with a private member `bookings`, which is a vector storing pairs of start and end times for booked events.

2. **Constructor:**
   - The constructor initializes the `MyCalendar` object. It doesn't require any parameters.

3. **Booking Function:**
   - The `book` method is used to attempt to book a new event with a specified start and end time.
   - It iterates through all previously booked events stored in `bookings`.
   - For each existing event, it checks if there is an overlap with the new event. Overlap occurs if the new event’s start time is before the end of the existing event, and the new event’s end time is after the start of the existing event.
   - If an overlap is found, the method returns `false`.
   - If no overlap is found, the new event is added to the `bookings` vector, and the method returns `true`.

## Java Code

1. **Class Definition:**
   - The `MyCalendar` class is defined with a private member `bookings`, which is an `ArrayList` that stores pairs of start and end times for each booked event.

2. **Constructor:**
   - The constructor initializes the `bookings` list where all future bookings will be stored.

3. **Booking Function:**
   - The `book` method is used to attempt booking a new event with start and end times.
   - It iterates through all existing bookings and checks for conflicts.
   - If an overlap is found between the new event and any existing event (using the same logic as in the C++ code), the method returns `false`.
   - If no conflict is found, the event is added to the `bookings` list, and `true` is returned to indicate a successful booking.

## JavaScript Code

1. **Class Definition:**
   - The `MyCalendar` class is created using a constructor function, initializing an empty `bookings` array to store the events.

2. **Booking Function:**
   - The `book` method is responsible for attempting to book a new event.
   - It loops through all the previously booked events and checks if the new event overlaps with any existing event.
   - If an overlap is detected, it returns `false`.
   - If no overlap is found, it adds the new event (represented as an array with start and end times) to the `bookings` array and returns `true` for a successful booking.

## Python Code

1. **Class Definition:**
   - The `MyCalendar` class is defined with a member `bookings`, which is a list storing tuples representing the start and end times of each event.

2. **Constructor:**
   - The constructor initializes the `bookings` list, which will store all booked events.

3. **Booking Function:**
   - The `book` method is responsible for attempting to book a new event with specified start and end times.
   - It checks if there is an overlap between the new event and any previously booked event by iterating through the `bookings` list.
   - If an overlap is found, the function returns `false`.
   - If no overlap is detected, the event is added to the `bookings` list and the function returns `true`, indicating the booking was successful.

## Go Code

1. **Struct Definition:**
   - A `MyCalendar` struct is defined with a field `bookings`, which is a 2D slice (slice of slices) to store start and end times for all booked events.

2. **Constructor:**
   - The `Constructor` function initializes and returns an empty `MyCalendar` struct with no bookings.

3. **Booking Function:**
   - The `Book` method is used to try and book a new event with start and end times.
   - It checks for conflicts by iterating through all previously booked events stored in the `bookings` field.
   - If an overlap is found between the new event and any existing event, the method returns `false`.
   - If no overlap is detected, the new event is appended to the `bookings` slice, and the method returns `true`, indicating the event was successfully booked.

---

Each code implementation follows the same general steps of iterating through existing bookings, checking for overlaps, and deciding whether to add the new event based on the overlap condition.
