# Are Sentences Similar - Step-by-Step Explanation

This README provides step-by-step explanations of the solution to determine if two sentences are similar across different programming languages: C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go.

### Problem Statement

Given two sentences, we need to determine if one sentence can be formed by removing some words (possibly none) from the middle of the other sentence, with the remaining words in the same order.

## General Approach

1. **Sentence Splitting**:
   - The first step in all languages is to split the sentences into words, so they can be compared word by word.

2. **Ensure Consistency**:
   - To simplify comparisons, we always ensure that the first sentence (`words1`) is the longer one. If not, we swap the sentences.

3. **Compare Words from Start**:
   - We start comparing the words of both sentences from the beginning. If the words match, we continue incrementing a counter (`start`).

4. **Compare Words from End**:
   - Similarly, we compare the words from the end of the sentences. If the words match, we continue incrementing a counter (`end`).

5. **Check Remaining Middle Part**:
   - Once the comparisons from the start and end are done, we check if the unmatched middle part of the longer sentence can be ignored. This is true if the sum of `start` and `end` counters is greater than or equal to the number of words in the shorter sentence.

### C++ Explanation

1. A helper function is defined to split a sentence into words using a loop.
2. Both sentences are split into word vectors.
3. If the second sentence is longer, we swap the vectors to ensure consistency.
4. We initialize two pointers (`start` and `end`) to 0.
5. Compare the words from the start of both sentences, incrementing `start` while words match.
6. Compare the words from the end of both sentences, incrementing `end` while words match.
7. Finally, we check if the unmatched middle part is valid by ensuring that the sum of `start` and `end` is greater than or equal to the length of the shorter sentence.

### Java Explanation

1. A helper method is defined to split a sentence into words using the `split` function.
2. Both sentences are split into arrays of words.
3. If the second sentence is longer, swap the word arrays to ensure consistency.
4. Initialize two pointers (`start` and `end`).
5. Compare the words from the start of both arrays, incrementing `start` while words match.
6. Compare the words from the end of both arrays, incrementing `end` while words match.
7. Check if the sum of `start` and `end` is greater than or equal to the length of the shorter sentence to determine if the middle part can be ignored.

### JavaScript Explanation

1. Define a helper function to split sentences into word arrays using the `split` method.
2. Split both sentences into arrays of words.
3. Swap the arrays if the second sentence has more words, ensuring the first array (`words1`) is longer.
4. Initialize two counters, `start` and `end`.
5. Compare words from the beginning of both arrays, incrementing `start` if they match.
6. Compare words from the end of both arrays, incrementing `end` if they match.
7. Ensure that the sum of `start` and `end` is greater than or equal to the length of the shorter sentence to ignore the unmatched middle part.

### Python Explanation

1. Split both sentences into lists of words using the `split()` function.
2. If the second list is longer, swap the lists to ensure consistency.
3. Initialize two counters, `start` and `end`.
4. Compare words from the start of both lists, incrementing `start` if they match.
5. Compare words from the end of both lists, incrementing `end` if they match.
6. Finally, verify that the sum of `start` and `end` is greater than or equal to the length of the shorter sentence, allowing the middle part to be ignored.

### Go Explanation

1. Split both sentences into slices of words using the `strings.Split()` function.
2. If the second slice is longer, swap the slices to ensure consistency.
3. Initialize two counters, `start` and `end`.
4. Compare words from the beginning of both slices, incrementing `start` if they match.
5. Compare words from the end of both slices, incrementing `end` if they match.
6. Check if the sum of `start` and `end` is greater than or equal to the length of the shorter slice to ignore the middle part of the sentence.

By following these step-by-step explanations, you can understand how the solution is implemented in various programming languages, ensuring that the logic remains consistent across each implementation. Each language uses its specific syntax and functions, but the core approach remains the same.
