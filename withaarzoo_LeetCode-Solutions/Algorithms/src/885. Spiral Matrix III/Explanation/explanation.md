# Spiral Matrix III - Step by Step Explanation

## C++ Solution

1. **Initialize Result Vector**:
   - Create a `result` vector to store the coordinates of the matrix in spiral order.

2. **Define Directions**:
   - Define four possible movement directions: right, down, left, and up.

3. **Initialize Steps and Direction**:
   - Start with 1 step and initialize the direction index to 0 (right).

4. **Set Starting Position**:
   - Set the starting position to the given `rStart` and `cStart`.
   - Add the starting position to the `result`.

5. **Loop Until All Cells Are Visited**:
   - Continue the loop until the `result` contains all the coordinates of the matrix.
   - For each direction, move `steps` times and then change the direction.
   - If the new position is within the bounds of the matrix, add it to the `result`.

6. **Increase Steps**:
   - After moving in two directions, increase the number of steps.

7. **Return Result**:
   - Return the `result` containing the coordinates of the matrix in spiral order.

## Java Solution

1. **Initialize Result List**:
   - Create a `result` list to store the coordinates of the matrix in spiral order.
