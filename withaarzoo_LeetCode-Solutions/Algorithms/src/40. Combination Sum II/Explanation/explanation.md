# Combination Sum II - Step-by-Step Explanation

This repository contains implementations of the `combinationSum2` algorithm in multiple programming languages: C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. The algorithm finds all unique combinations of numbers from a list that sum up to a given target. Each combination is unique, and the same number cannot be used multiple times.

## Common Steps Across All Implementations

1. **Sorting the Input Array**:  
   The candidates array is sorted to handle duplicates easily and optimize the backtracking process. This ensures that the algorithm can skip over duplicate elements and stop early when itâ€™s clear that no further combination will meet the target.

2. **Backtracking Setup**:  
   Backtracking is used to explore all possible combinations. A helper function is defined that recursively tries to build combinations by adding elements from the sorted array.

3. **Base Case - Target Reached**:  
   If the target becomes zero, it indicates that the current combination sums up to the desired target. This combination is then added to the result list.

4. **Skipping Duplicates**:  
   To avoid generating duplicate combinations, the algorithm skips over elements that are the same as the previous one when iterating through the array.

5. **Early Stopping**:  
   If an element in the sorted array exceeds the current target, the loop breaks because any subsequent elements will also be too large.

6. **Backtracking**:  
   After exploring a combination, the last element added is removed (backtracking) to try other possible combinations.

## C++ Implementation

1. **Sort the Input Array**:  
   The candidates array is sorted to make duplicate handling easier.

2. **Initialize Result and Current Combination Vectors**:  
   Two vectors are initialized, one for storing valid combinations and one for tracking the current combination being explored.

3. **Backtracking Function**:  
   The main function calls a helper function `backtrack`, passing the current index, target, current combination, and result.

4. **Base Case - Target Reached**:  
   If the target is zero, the current combination is added to the result.

5. **Iterate Through Candidates**:  
   The loop iterates through the candidates, skipping duplicates and stopping early if the candidate exceeds the target.

6. **Recursively Backtrack**:  
   The `backtrack` function is called recursively with the updated target and the next index.

7. **Backtrack - Remove Last Element**:  
   After exploring a path, the last element is removed to explore other combinations.

## Java Implementation

1. **Sort the Array**:  
   The array is sorted for easier handling of duplicates.

2. **Initialize Result and Temporary List**:  
   Two lists are created: one for storing results and one for the current combination.

3. **Backtracking Method**:  
   A helper method `backtrack` is defined to handle the recursive exploration of combinations.

4. **Base Case - Target Zero**:  
   If the target is zero, a copy of the current list is added to the result.

5. **Loop Through Candidates**:  
   The loop checks for duplicates and whether the current candidate can be part of a valid combination.

6. **Recursive Exploration**:  
   The `backtrack` method is called with an updated target and index.

7. **Remove Last Element**:  
   Backtrack by removing the last added element before exploring the next candidate.

## JavaScript Implementation

1. **Sort the Candidates Array**:  
   The array is sorted to manage duplicates and allow early stopping.

2. **Initialize Result and Current Arrays**:  
   Arrays are initialized to store results and the current combination.

3. **Define Backtracking Function**:  
   A function `backtrack` is defined to explore combinations.

4. **Check for Target Zero**:  
   When the target is zero, the current combination is added to the result.

5. **Iterate Through Candidates**:  
   The loop skips duplicates and breaks early if a candidate is too large.

6. **Recursive Backtracking**:  
   Call `backtrack` recursively with the remaining target and next index.

7. **Backtrack by Popping Last Element**:  
   Remove the last element to try other combinations.

## Python Implementation

1. **Sort the Candidates List**:  
   The list is sorted to facilitate duplicate handling and early stopping.

2. **Initialize Result List**:  
   A list is created to store the valid combinations.

3. **Backtracking Function**:  
   A nested function `backtrack` is defined to handle recursive exploration.

4. **Check for Target Zero**:  
   When the target reaches zero, the current combination is added to the result.

5. **Loop Through Candidates**:  
   The loop skips duplicates and stops early if a candidate is greater than the target.

6. **Recursively Call Backtrack**:  
   Call `backtrack` recursively with the reduced target and updated index.

7. **Backtrack by Removing Last Element**:  
   After exploring a combination, the last element is removed to try another path.

## Go Implementation

1. **Sort the Input Slice**:  
   The slice is sorted for managing duplicates and stopping early.

2. **Initialize Result and Current Slices**:  
   Slices are initialized to store results and the current combination.

3. **Define Backtracking Function**:  
   A function `backtrack` is defined to recursively explore combinations.

4. **Check for Target Zero**:  
   When the target is zero, the current combination is added to the result.

5. **Iterate Over Candidates**:  
   The loop checks for duplicates and breaks if a candidate exceeds the target.

6. **Recursive Backtracking**:  
   The `backtrack` function is called with the updated target and index.

7. **Backtrack by Popping Last Element**:  
   The last added element is removed to explore other possibilities.
