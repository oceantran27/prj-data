# Given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) 
# You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
# The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
# Return the maximum area of an island in grid. 
# If there is no island, return 0.

Explaination:
We are allowed to move 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) so the possible 
in a matrix if we are at x and y possition the possible moveing are

>> directions = [(x,y+1),(x,y-1),(x+1,y),(x-1,y)] also we need to care of boundary cases as well
    which are x and y can not be smaller than 0 and greater than number of rows and colums respectively.


Visualization
mat = [
  [0,0,A,0,0,0,0,B,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,B,B,B,0,0,0],
  [0,C,C,0,D,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,C,0,0,D,D,0,0,E,0,E,0,0],
  [0,C,0,0,D,D,0,0,E,E,E,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,E,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,F,F,F,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,F,F,0,0,0,0]
]

For visualization I have defined the connected island with alphabates.
by observation we can see that 
    A island is of area 1
    B island is of area 4
    C island is of area 4
    D island is of area 5
    E island is of area 6 and
    F island is of area 5

it has 6 unique island's of mentioned area's
and maximum of all of them is 6 so we return 6.
