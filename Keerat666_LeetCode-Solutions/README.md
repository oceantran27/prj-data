## Major Announcement 

Hacktoberfest has excluded all repository contributions which were made to this repo because this repo contains a list of algorithms. Any repo which contains just a list or any kind of algorithms does not comply with their policies. I tried my best to convinve them about this repo not being one of them but they weren't convinced.

Really sorry to all the contributors who participated in this repo for the HacktoberFest.

What I can max do next, is to get feedback from all of you and try to come up with repos for your favourite languages/frameworks

https://github.com/Keerat666/LeetCode-Solutions/discussions/143

In case someone wants to contribute for Express.js, they can check this repo out!

Really a big sorry to everyone but I hope the work that we have all done makes our Leetcoding experience a bit better!

### Tl;dr : This repo is now excluded from Hacktoberfest22.

# LeetCode-Solutions


## Instructions

- Add a new issue for any Leetcode Problem that you want to solve in a language of your choice
- Wait for the issue to be assigned to you
- Once the issue is assigned, fork the repo and start working on it
- If the problem is already solved in any other language than the one you have chosen, there would be an existing folder with the id and the name of the problem.
- Add your solution inside that problem folder
- If the folder is not created, then create the folder with the id and name as explained in the folder structure block below
- Raise a PR once you think you are ready
- Make sure to mention the issue id/issue link in the PR Comment for enabling faster review of your commit
- Wait for your PR to get reviewed
- Once the PR is merged spread the word and keep contributing until your Hacktoberfest quota of PR's are done 


## Folder Structure

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/dQSyD0J/Screenshot-2022-10-09-at-3-27-51-AM.png)

Then a valid folder structure would be : 

```
Leetcode-Easy/9-PalindromeNumber
```
- Solution for the problem palindrome number should be uploaded inside this folder in any language of your choice.
