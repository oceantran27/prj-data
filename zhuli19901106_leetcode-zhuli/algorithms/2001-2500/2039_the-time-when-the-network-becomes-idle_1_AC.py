# https://leetcode.com/problems/the-time-when-the-network-becomes-idle/
# the description is insanely long, summary like this:
# - all edges weigh 1
# - data send to master and await reply
# - keep waiting patience[i] seconds and resend, unless already replied
# - how long it takes for all to be done
# because there's no concept of congestion and limit
# no interference between nodes exists
