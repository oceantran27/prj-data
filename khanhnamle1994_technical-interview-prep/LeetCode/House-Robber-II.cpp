/* After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will
not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is
the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the
previous street.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of
money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. */

/* This problem is a little tricky at first glance. However, if you have finished the House Robber problem, this
problem can simply be decomposed into two House Robber problems.

Suppose there are n houses, since house 0 and n - 1 are now neighbors, we cannot rob them together and thus the
solution is now the maximum of
1 - Rob houses 0 to n - 2;
2 - Rob houses 1 to n - 1. */
