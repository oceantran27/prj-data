Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index. */

/* For some position.
cast 1: We can exhaust it's step length, call this type of jump "J1"
cast 2: We can stop prematurely, call this type of jump "J2"
if we chose case 2, we prematurely get one more jump time, Does this really we want ? if the new position has long enough step,this just we want!.

Has current position's index be "I", step lenght be "L",
case 1: total step length of this "J1" jump and next "J1" jump is L + nums[i + L], call this length as "LENGTH".
case 2: For each index "i" in (I, I+L) , total step length of this "J1" jump and next "J2" jump is (i - I) + nums[i], call these length "LENGTH_1 LENGTH_2 .......LENGTH_X"

the max value of LENGTH, LENGTH_1, LENGTH_2 ... LENGTH_X can easy be calculate, so we also know how to use the current position's step length, exhaust it or prematurely stop at which postion. */
