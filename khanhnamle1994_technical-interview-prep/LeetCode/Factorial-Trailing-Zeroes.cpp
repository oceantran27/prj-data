/* Zeros can only generated on prime factors of 5s and 2s.
>> Lets' say 5s = {5*1, 5*2 ... 5*n}, 2s = {2*1, 2*2 ... 2*n}. So in this problem we need to count how many 5s and 2s.
>> Note that in n!, the 2s are always more than 5s, so we simplify the problem into counting the 5s.

>> There are several cases on 5s.  They are 5, 5^2, 5^3 ...
>> First let's see how to count 5s,  all we need is to compute floor (n/5).
>> Then let's deal with 5^n.
>> E.g., n = 28,  it has 5s =  [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
>> When we count 5s using floor(n/5), we have the length 5, but 25 = 5*5, there should be another 5 and the length is 6.
To count this, we can continue counting 5s using n divide by 5, 5^2, 5^3 ... In this way, all the 5s can be found. */
