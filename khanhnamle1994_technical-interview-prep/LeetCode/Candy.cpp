// There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

// You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
// * Each child must have at least one candy.
// * Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

// What is the minimum candies you must give?

/* Example 1:
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions. */

  return total + 1;
}

// The idea is to split the sequence into "mountains", where a mountain is an increasing sequance followed by a decreasing sequence.

// Take this for example: [3,4,5,6,3,2]. The algorithm will compute length of the increasing sequence [3, 4, 5] -> left = 3 and decreasing sequence [3, 2] -> right = 2 (peak is not included). Then we add (left * (left + 1) + (right * right + 1)) / 2 + max(left, right) + 1 to the total result.

// Consecutive equal elements are treated as mountains formed of a single element.

// One last observation is how I handle the mountain interference. For example: [2,3,2,4,3] has mountains [2,3,2] and [2,4,3] with a common element 2 (the mountain's last element is the next mountain's first element. To handle this I never account for the last element of the mountain, but add 1 to the result in the end.
