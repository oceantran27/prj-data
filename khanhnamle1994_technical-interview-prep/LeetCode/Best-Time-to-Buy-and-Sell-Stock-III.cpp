// Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
// Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

/* Example 1
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

Example 3:
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0. */

// Time complexity is O(kn), space complexity can be O(n) because this DP only uses the result from last step. But for cleaness this solution still used O(kn) space complexity to preserve similarity to the equations in the comments.
