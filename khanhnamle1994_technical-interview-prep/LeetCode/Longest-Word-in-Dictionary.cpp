// Given a list of strings words representing an English Dictionary, find the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words. If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.

// If there is no answer, return the empty string.

/* Example 1:
Input:
words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation:
The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".

Example 2:
Input:
words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation:
Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply". */

      if (w.size() == 1 || built.count(w.substr(0, w.size() - 1))) {
          res = w.size() > res.size() ? w : res;
          built.insert(w);
      }
  }
  return res;
}

// 1 - Sort the words alphabetically, therefore shorter words always comes before longer words;
// 2 - Along the sorted list, populate the words that can be built;
// 3 - Any prefix of a word must comes before that word.
