/* In an election, the i-th vote was cast for persons[i] at time times[i].

Now, we would like to implement the following query function: TopVotedCandidate.q(int t) will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time t.

Votes cast at time t will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

Example 1:
Input: ["TopVotedCandidate","q","q","q","q","q","q"], [[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30]],[3],[12],[25],[15],[24],[8]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,0,0,1]

Explanation:
At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
This continues for 3 more queries at time 15, 24, and 8. */

map<int, int> m;

    int n = persons.size(), lead = -1;
    unordered_map<int, int> count;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) m[times[i]] = persons[i];
    for (auto it : m) {
        if (++count[it.second] >= count[lead])lead = it.second;
        m[it.first] = lead;
    }

int q(int t) {
    return (--m.upper_bound(t))-> second;
