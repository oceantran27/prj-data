Input: "sea", "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea". */

* Skip character in both string (dp[i - 1][j - 1]).

* Skip character in the first string (dp[i - 1][j]). Add one deleted character
* Skip character in the second string (dp[i][j - 1]). Add one deleted one character */
