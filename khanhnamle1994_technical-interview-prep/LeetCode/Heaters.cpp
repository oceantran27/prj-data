// Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

// Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses
// could be covered by those heaters.

// So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard
// of heaters.

/* Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3],[2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4],[1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed. */
