// Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

// Analysis
/*
The requirement is O(n) time and O(1) space. Thus, the  "first sort and then find " way is not working. Also the "hash map" way is not working.
Since we can not sort the array, we shall find a cumulative way, which is not about the ordering.
XOR is a good way, we can use the property that A XOR A = 0, and A XOR B XOR A = B.
So, the code becomes extremely easy.
