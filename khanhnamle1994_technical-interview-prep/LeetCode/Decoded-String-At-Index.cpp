/* An encoded string S is given.  To find and write the decoded string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:
>> If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
>> If the character read is a digit (say d), the entire current tape is repeatedly written d-1 more times in total.

Now for some encoded string S, and an index K, find and return the K-th letter (1 indexed) in the decoded string.

Example 1:
Input: S = "leet2code3", K = 10
Output: "o"
Explanation:
The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
The 10th letter in the string is "o".

Example 2:
Input: S = "ha22", K = 5
Output: "h"
Explanation:
The decoded string is "hahahaha".  The 5th letter is "h".

Example 3:
Input: S = "a2345678999999999999999", K = 1
Output: "a"
Explanation:
The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.  The 1st letter is "a". */

    while (i--)
        if (isdigit(S[i]))
            N /= S[i] - '0', K %= N;
        else if (K % N-- == 0)
            return string(1, S[i]);
    return "lee215";
