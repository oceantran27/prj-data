// There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them contains poison, the rest are filled with water. They all look the same. If a pig drinks that poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket contains the poison within one hour.

// Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the follow-up general case.

// Follow Up:
// If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out the "poison" bucket within p minutes? There is exact one bucket with poison.

int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
  return ceil(log(buckets)/log(minutesToTest/minutesToDie+1));  // log_{T+1}(N)
}
