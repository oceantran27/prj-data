// There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
// Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
// Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
// There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

/* For example:
2, [[1,0]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1]

4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
There are a total of 4 courses to take.
To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3]. */
