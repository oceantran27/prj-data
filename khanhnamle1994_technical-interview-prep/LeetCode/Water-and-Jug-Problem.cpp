// You are given two jugs with capacities x and y litres. There is an infinite amount of water supply available.
// You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly z litres using these two jugs.

// If z liters of water is measurable, you must have z liters of water contained within one or both buckets by the end.

/* Operations allowed:
* Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
* Empty any of the jugs.
* Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.

Example 1: (From the famous "Die Hard" example)

Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4
Output: True

Example 2:

Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5
Output: False */

bool canMeasureWater(int x, int y, int z) {
  return z == 0 || z <= (long long)x + y && z % __gcd(x, y) == 0;
}

/* The only thing we should proof is this:

"if x and y are coprime,  then we can and only can reach every integer z in [0, x + y]. (1)"

then for a GCD g, from gx and gy,
we can and only can reach every z in {i * g | i in [0, x + y] }

now, let’s see how to proof (1).
>> let x be the less one, and y the greater one.
>> then fill the two jug to full, we have x and y water each and x + y water in total.
>> then we pour out x water each time until we can’t.

now we have these different z:

"y + x,  y,  y - x,  y - 2x, ... , y % x"

>> finally we have y % x water left, we pour it into the x jug,
>> then fill the y jug to full.
>> now the two jugs have y % x and y water separately,
>> and y + y % x water in total.
>> then we pour from y jug into x jug until the x jug is full,
>> afterwards do the same thing like before,
>> to pour out x water each time until we can’t.
>> finally we get (y + y % x) % x = (y % x + y % x) % x = (2y) % x water left.

now we have these different z:

 "y + y % x,   y + y % x - x,  y + y % x - 2x, ... ,  (2y) % x"

do this x times, we get z:

 y + (2y) % x,  y + (2y) % x - x, y + (2y) % x - 2x, ..., (3y) % x
 :
 :
 :
 y + ((x-1)y) % x,  y + ((x-1)y) % x - x,  y + ((x-1)y) % x - 2x, ... ,  (xy) % x

>> then you see (xy) % x = 0, and
set { y % x, (2y) % x, (3y) % x, ... , ((x-1)y) % x } just equals to { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... , x - 1 } . (2)

proof for (2):
>> modulo x could get x - 1 different results at most exclusive 0, that’s 1,2,3,…,x-1.
>> we have x - 1 expressions, suppose there is two same,
>> let a != b in [1, x-1] and (ay) % x = (by) % x,
>> then we get ((a - b)y) % x = 0,
>> then ((a - b) % x) * (y % x) = 0, (a - b) % x = 0.
>> for 1 <= a, b <= x - 1, so we get a = b. it’s impossible.

so we can get any z in [0, x + y] water for coprime x and y. */
