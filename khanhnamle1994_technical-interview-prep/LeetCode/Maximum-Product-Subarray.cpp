// Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.
// For example, given the array [2,3,-2,4], the contiguous subarray [2,3] has the largest product = 6.

/* Analysis:
Note that, we need to consider two cases:
(1) negative numbers:
Store the minimum product to handle the case that new element < 0. Because if current element < 0, the product of two negative numbers
(new element, and minimum product before the new element) become positive.

(2) zeros:
When meets zero, current max and min product become 0, new search is needed from the next element.

Therefore, we can write down to function to store both + and - products:
max_product = max{A[i]*min_product (when A[i]<0),  A[i]*max_product (when A[i]>0),  A[i] (when 0 occurs before A[i]) }.
min_product = min{A[i]*min_product,  A[i]*max_product,  A[i] }.

Because current sequence might start from any element, to get the final result, we also need to store the max product after each iteration
"res = max(res, maxp);". */

            maxp = max(max(tmpmax* A[i], tmpmin* A[i]), A[i]);
            minp = min(min(tmpmax* A[i], tmpmin* A[i]), A[i]);
