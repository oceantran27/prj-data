// You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes.
// The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

// Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except
// for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore,
// there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

// Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

/* Example 1:
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed. */

/* Example 2:
Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it
could be shorter as mentioned above. */
