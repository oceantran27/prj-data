/* We have a two dimensional matrix A where each value is 0 or 1.

A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column: changing all 0s to 1s, and all 1s to 0s.

After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible score.

Example 1:

Input: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 39
Explanation:
Toggled to [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].
0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39 */

int matrixScore(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
  int M = A.size(), N = A[0].size(), res = (1 << (N - 1)) * M;
  for (int j = 1; j < N; j++) {
      int cur = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) cur += A[i][j] == A[i][0];
      res += max(cur, M - cur) * (1 << (N - j - 1));
  }
  return res;
}

/* Assume A is M * N.
1 - A[i][0] is worth 1 << (N - 1) points, more than the sum of (A[i][1] + .. + A[i][N-1]). We need to toggle all A[i][0] to 1, here I toggle all lines for A[i][0] = 0.
2 - A[i][j] is worth 1 << (N - 1 - j)
For every col, I count the current number of 1s.
After step 1, A[i][j] becomes 1 if A[i][j] == A[i][0].
if M - cur > cur, we can toggle this column to get more 1s.
max(M, M - cur) will be the maximum number of 1s that we can get. */
