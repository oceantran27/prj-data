// Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
// Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.
// For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
// Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

bool isUgly(int num) {
  for (int i = 2; i < 6 && num; i++) {
    while (num % i == 0) {
      num /= i;
    }
  }
  return num == 1;
}

// Just divide by 2, 3 and 5 as often as possible and then check whether we arrived at 1.
// Also try divisor 4 if that makes the code simpler / less repetitive.
