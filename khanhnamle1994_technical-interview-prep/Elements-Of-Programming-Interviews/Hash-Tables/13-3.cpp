// The ISBN is a unique commercial book identifier. It is a string of length 10. The first 9 characters are digits; the last character is a
// character. The check character is the sum of the first 9 digits, modulo 11, with 10 represented by 'X'. Create a cache for looking up
// prices of books identified by their ISBN. You implement lookup, insert, and remove methods. Use the LRU policy for cache eviction. If an
// ISBN is already present, insert should not change the price, but it should update that entry to be the most recently used entry. Lookup
// should also update that entry to be the most recently used entry.

// Hash tables are ideally suited for fast lookup. We can use a hash table to quickly lookup price by using ISBN as keys. Along with each key,
// we store a value, which is the price and the most recent time a lookup was done on that key. This yields O(1) lookup times on cache hits.

// Inserts into the cache are also O(1) time, until the cache is full. Once the cache fills up, to add a new entry we ahve to find the LRU
// entry, which will be evicted to make place for the new entry. Finding this entry takes O(n) time, where n is the cache size.

// Maintain a separate queue of keys. In the hash table we store for each key a reference to its location in the queue. Each time an ISBN is
// looked up and is found in the hash table, it is moved to the front of the queue. When the length of the queue exceeds n, when a new element
// is added to the cache, the item at the tail of the queue is deleted from the cache, i.e., from the queue and the hash table.
