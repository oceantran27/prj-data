// Write a program which takes text for an anonymous letter and text for a magazine and determines if it is possible to write the
// anonymous letter using the magazine. The anonymous letter can be written using the magazine if for each character in the anonymous
// letter, the number of times it appears in the anonymous letter is no more than the number of times it appears in the magazine

// A brute force approach is to count for each character in the character set the number of times it appears in the letter and in the
// magazine. If any character occurs more often in the letter than the magazine we return false, otherwise we return true. This approach
// is potentially slow because it iterates over all characters, including those that do not occur in the letter or magazine. It also
// makes multiple passes over both the letter and the magazine - as many passes as there are characters in the character set.

// A better approach is to make a single pass over the letter, storing the character counts for the letter in a single hash table - keys
// are characters, and values are the number of times that character appears. Next, we make a pass over the magazine. When processing a
// character c, if c appears in the hash table, we reduce its count by 1; we remove it from the hash when its count goes to 0. If the hash
// becomes empty, we return true. If we reach the end of the letter and the hash is non-empty, we return false - each of the characters
// remaining in the hash occurs more times in the letter than the magazine.

  // Check if the characters in magazine_text can cover characters in char_frequency_for_letter

}

// In the worst case, the letter is not constructible or the last character of the magazine is essentially required. Therefore, the time
// complexity is O(m + n) where m and n are the number of characters in the letter and magazine, respectively. The space complexity is
// the size of the hash table constructed in the pass over the letter, i.e., O(L), where L is the number of distinct characters appearing
// in the letter.
