// Write a program that checks whether a binary tree is symmetric.

/* Solution:
We can test if a tree is symmetric by computing its mirror image and seeing if the mirror image is equal to the original tree. Computing the
mirror image of a tree is as simple as swapping the left and right subtrees, and recursively continuing. The time and space complexity are
both O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

The insight to a better algorithm is that we do not need to construct the mirrored subtrees. All that is important is whether a pair of subtrees
are mirror images. As soon as a pair fails the test, we can short circuit the check to false. */

  }

  // One subtree is empty, and the other is not
  return false;
}

// The time complexity and space complexity are O(n) and O(h), respectively, where n is the number of nodes in the tree and h is the height of the tree
