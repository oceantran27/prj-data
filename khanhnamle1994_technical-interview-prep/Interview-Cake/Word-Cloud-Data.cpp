// You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

// To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in an unordered map ↴ , where the keys
// are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.

// Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:
// "After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:"
// "Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar."

// What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your final unordered map should include one "Add" or "add" with
// a value of 22. Make reasonable (not necessarily perfect) decisions about cases like "After" and "Dana".

// Assume the input will only contain words and standard punctuation.

/* Solution
In our solution, we make two decisions:
1 - We use a class. This allows us to tie our methods together, calling them on instances of our class instead of passing references.
2 - To handle duplicate words with different cases, we choose to make a word uppercase in our unordered map only if it is always uppercase
in the original string. While this is a reasonable approach, it is imperfect (consider proper nouns that are also lowercase words, like
"Bill" and "bill").

To split the words in the input string and populate an unordered map of the unique words to the number of times they occurred, we:
1 - Split words by spaces and ellipses—making sure to include hyphens surrounded by characters. We also include all apostrophes (which will
handle contractions nicely but will break possessives into separate words).
2 - Populate the words in our unordered map as they are identified, checking if the word is already in our unordered map in its current case
or another case.

If the input word is uppercase and there's a lowercase version in the unordered map, we increment the lowercase version's count. If the
input word is lowercase and there's an uppercase version in the unordered map, we "demote" the uppercase version by adding the lowercase
version and giving it the uppercase version's count. */
