// A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a
// two-dimensional plane.

// They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is
// the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.

// Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.

// As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with
// either the x-axis or the y-axis.

// They are defined as instances of the Rectangle class:
class Rectangle
{
private:
  // coordinates of bottom left corner
  int leftX_;
  int bottomY_;

  // dimensions
  int width_;
  int height_;

/* Solution:

We divide the problem into two halves:
1 - The intersection along the x-axis
2 - The intersection along the y-axis

Both problems are basically the same as finding the intersection of two "ranges" on a 1-dimensional number line.

So we write a helper function findRangeOverlap() that can be used to find both the x overlap and the y overlap, and we use it to build
the rectangular overlap: */
