// You are a renowned thief who has recently switched from stealing precious metals to stealing cakes because of the insane profit margins.
// You end up hitting the jackpot, breaking into the world's largest privately owned stock of cakes—the vault of the Queen of England.

// While Queen Elizabeth has a limited number of types of cake, she has an unlimited supply of each type.

// Each type of cake has a weight and a value, stored in objects of a CakeType class:

class CakeType
{
public:
    size_t weight_;
    long long value_;

    CakeType(size_t weight = 0, long long value = 0) :
        weight_(weight),
        value_(value)
    {
    }
};

// For example:
// weighs 7 kilograms and has a value of 160 shillings
CakeType(7, 160);

// weighs 3 kilograms and has a value of 90 shillings
CakeType(3, 90);

// You brought a duffel bag that can hold limited weight, and you want to make off with the most valuable haul possible.

// Write a function maxDuffelBagValue() that takes a vector of cake type objects and a weight capacity, and returns the maximum monetary value the
// duffel bag can hold.

// For example:
const vector<CakeType> cakeTypes {
    CakeType(7, 160),
    CakeType(3, 90),
    CakeType(2, 15),
};

size_t capacity = 20;

maxDuffelBagValue(cakeTypes, capacity);
// returns 555 (6 of the middle type of cake and 1 of the last type of cake)

// Solution
// This is a classic computer science puzzle called "the unbounded knapsack problem."

/// We use a bottom-up approach to find the max value at our duffel bag's weightCapacity by finding the max value at every capacity from 0 to
// weightCapacity.

// We then allocate a vector maxValuesAtCapacities where the indices are capacities and each value is the max value at that capacity.

// For each capacity, we want to know the max monetary value we can carry. To figure that out, we go through each cake, checking to see if we should
// take that cake.

// The best monetary value we can get if we take a given cake is simply:
// 1. that cake's value, plus
// 2. the best monetary value we can carry in our remaining duffel bag capacity after taking the cake—which we'll already have stored in maxValuesAtCapacities

// To handle weights and values of zero, we throw a range error only if a cake weighs nothing and has a positive value.

long long maxDuffelBagValue(const vector<CakeType>& cakeTypes, size_t weightCapacity)
{
    // we make an array to hold the maximum possible value at every
    // duffel bag weight capacity from 0 to weightCapacity
    // starting each index with value 0
    vector<long long> maxValuesAtCapacities(weightCapacity + 1);

    for (size_t currentCapacity = 0; currentCapacity <= weightCapacity; ++currentCapacity) {

        // set a variable to hold the max monetary value so far for currentCapacity
        long long currentMaxValue = 0;

        for (const CakeType& cakeType : cakeTypes) {

            // if a cake weighs 0 and has a positive value,
            // the value of our duffel bag is infinite!
            if (cakeType.weight_ == 0 && cakeType.value_ != 0) {
                throw range_error("Max value is infinity!");
            }

            // if the current cake weighs as much or less than the current weight capacity
            // it's possible taking the cake would get a better value
            if (cakeType.weight_ <= currentCapacity) {

                // so we check: should we use the cake or not?
                // if we use the cake, the most kilograms we can include in addition to the cake
                // we're adding is the current capacity minus the cake's weight. we find the max
                // value at that integer capacity in our array maxValuesAtCapacities
                long long maxValueUsingCake = cakeType.value_
                        + maxValuesAtCapacities[currentCapacity - cakeType.weight_];

                // now we see if it's worth taking the cake. how does the
                // value with the cake compare to the currentMaxValue?
                currentMaxValue = max(maxValueUsingCake, currentMaxValue);
            }
        }

        // add each capacity's max value to our array so we can use them
        // when calculating all the remaining capacities
        maxValuesAtCapacities[currentCapacity] = currentMaxValue;
    }

    return maxValuesAtCapacities[weightCapacity];
}

// Complexity
// O(n∗k) time, and O(k) space, where n is number of types of cake and k is the capacity of the duffel bag. We loop through each cake (n cakes)
// for every capacity (k capacities), so our runtime is O(n∗k), and maintaining the vector of k+1 capacities gives us the O(k) space.
