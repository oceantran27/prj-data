- pntr1 and pntr2 start out by both pointing to the head node
- pntr2 is then advanced n-1 nodes.  pntr1 is still pointing to the head. After
this, we keep advancing pntr2 by one node and pntr 1 is also advanced by one node
- Once pntr2 is equal to null we know we  have reached the last node and pntr1
now points to the nth to last node, and we can return our answer as the node
that pntr1 is pointing to. */
