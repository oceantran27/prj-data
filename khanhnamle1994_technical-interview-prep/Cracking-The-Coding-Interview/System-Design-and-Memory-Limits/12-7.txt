You have to design a database that can store terabytes of data. It should support efficient range queries. How would you do it?

Construct an index for each field that requires range queries. Use a B+ tree to implement the index. A B+ tree organizes sorted data
for efficient insertion, retrieval and removal of records. Each record is identified by a key (for this problem, it is the field value).
Since it is a dynamic, multilevel index, finding the beginning of the range depends only on the height of the tree, which is usually
quite small. Record references are stored in the leaves, sorted by the key. Additional records can be found by following a next block
reference. Records will be sequentially available until the key value reaches the maximum value specified in the query.

Thus, runtimes will be dominated by the number of elements in a range.  Avoid using trees that store data at interior nodes, as traversing
the tree will be expensive since it wonâ€™t be resident in memory.
