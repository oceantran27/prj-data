Add arithmetic operators (plus, minus, times, divide) to make the following expression true: 3 1 3 6 = 8.
You can use any parentheses you’d like.

An interviewer is asking this problem to see how you think and approach problems—so don’t just guess randomly.

Try approaching this the following way: What sorts of operations would get us to 8? I can think of a few:
>> 4 * 2 = 8
>> 16 / 2 = 8
>> 4 + 4 = 8

Let’s start with the first one. Is there any way to make 3 1 3 6 produce 4 * 2?
>> We can easily notice that 3 + 1 = 4 (the first two numbers).
>> We can also notice that 6 / 3 = 2.
>> If we had “3 1 6 3”, we’d be done, since (3 + 1)*(6 / 3) = 8. Although it seems a little unconventional to do this, we can, in fact,
just flip the 6 and the 3 to get the solution:
(( 3 + 1 ) / 3) * 6 = 8
