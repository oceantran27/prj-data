You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play 1 of 2 games.
Game #1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game #2: You get three shots and you have to make 2 of 3 shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

Probability of winning Game 1: p
Probability of winning Game 2:
>> Let s(k,n) be the probability of making exactly k shots out of n. The probability of winning game 2 is s(2, 3) + s(3, 3).
Since, s(k, n) = C(n, k) ( 1- p)^(n - k) p^k, the probability of winning is 3 * (1 - p) * p^2 + p^3.
Simplified, it becomes 3 * p^2 - 2 * p^3.

You should play Game1 if P(Game1) > P(Game2):
>> p > 3 * p^2 - 2 * p^3.
>> 1 > 3 * p - 2 * p^2
>> 2 * p^2 - 3 * p + 1 > 0
>> (2p - 1)(p - 1) > 0

Both terms must be positive or both must be negative. But we know p < 1, so (p - 1) < 0. This means both terms must be negative.
>> (2p - 1) < 0
>> 2p < 1
>> p < .5

So, we should play Game1 if p < .5.
