There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two or all of them)
if they start walking on the sides of the triangle?

Similarly find the probability of collision with ‘n’ ants on an ‘n’ vertex polygon.

None of the three ants will collide if all three are moving in clockwise direction, or all three are moving in a counter-clockwise
direction. Otherwise, there will definitely be a collision.

How many ways are there for the three ants to move? Each ant can move in 2 directions, so there are 2^3 ways the ant can move. There
are only two ways which will avoid a collision, therefore the probability of collision is (2^3 – 2) / (2^3) = 6 / 8 = 3 / 4.

To generalize this to an n-vertex polygon: there are still only 2 ways in which the ants can move to avoid a collision, but there are
2^n ways they can move total. Therefore, in general, probability of collision is (2^n – 2) / 2^n = 1 – 1/2^(n-1).
