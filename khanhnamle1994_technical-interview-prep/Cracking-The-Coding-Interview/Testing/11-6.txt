How would you test an ATM in a distributed banking system?

The first thing to do on this question is to clarify assumptions. Ask the following questions:
»» Who is going to use the ATM? Answers might be “anyone,” or it might be “blind people” - or any number of other answers.
»» What are they going to use it for? Answers might be “withdrawing money,” “transferring money,” “checking their balance,” or many
other answers.
»» What tools do we have to test? Do we have access to the code, or just the ATM machine?

Remember: a good tester makes sure she knows what she’s testing!

Here are a few test cases for how to test just the withdrawing functionality:
»» Withdrawing money less than the account balance
»» Withdrawing money greater than the account balance
»» Withdrawing money equal to the account balance
»» Withdrawing money from an ATM and from the internet at the same time
»» Withdrawing money when the connection to the bank’s network is lost
»» Withdrawing money from multiple ATMs simultaneously
