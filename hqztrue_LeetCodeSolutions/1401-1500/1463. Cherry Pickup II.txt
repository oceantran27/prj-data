1. DP, O(nm^2).
2. Reduce to the problem of finding two vertex-disjoint paths in a nonnegatively-weighted directed graph, by replacing each node with a node with weight being the number of cherries and a node with weight 0. Use Suurballe's algorithm and perform two rounds of dijkstra. O(nm log (nm)).
