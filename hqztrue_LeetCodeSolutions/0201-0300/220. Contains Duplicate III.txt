1. sliding window, use data structures that support insert, delete, pred, succ. balanced tree, O(n log n). or vEB tree/y-fast trie for integers, O(n log log W).
2. sliding window+hashing, use bucket with size k. each bucket will contain at most 1 element, otherwise we already return true. only need to check 3 buckets when we search. O(n).
