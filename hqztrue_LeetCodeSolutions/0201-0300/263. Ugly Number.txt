divide by 2,3,5.
1. naive, divide step by step. O(log n).
2. binary search on the number of 2,3,5, the number of occurrence is at most O(log n). O(log log n).
3. use __builtin_ctz to remove power of 2. there are O(log^2 n) ugly numbers, can precompute and construct a hash table. O(1) query, O(log^2 n) preprocessing.
