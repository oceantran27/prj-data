1. enumerate j and k. O(n^2).
2. divide into blocks. O~(n^{3/2}). see my article https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-increasing-quadruplets/solution/geng-kuai-de-on15-by-hqztrue-ij92/

This result has already appeared in SODA'21. \cite{even2021counting}
Conditional lower bound and O(n^{1.48}) time algorithm: ISAAC'20 \cite{dudek2020counting}
