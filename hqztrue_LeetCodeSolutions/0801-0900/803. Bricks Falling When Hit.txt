offline, add bricks in reverse order. whenever we add a brick, use dfs to find new bricks connected to the top. O(nm).

remark. this is a special case of the single source bottleneck shortest path problem in undirected graphs, which can be solved in randomized O(nm) time by reducing to minimum spanning tree \cite{karger1995randomized}.
