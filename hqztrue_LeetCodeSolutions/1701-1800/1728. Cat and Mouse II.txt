let l denote max(catJump,mouseJump).
DP, let f[i1][j1][i2][j2][0..1] denote whether the mouse can win when the mouse is at (i1,j1), the cat is at (i2,j2), and mouse/cat moves first. (Furthermore, if the mouse can win, record the minimum number of steps for the mouse to reach the food.) Use bfs to compute f (start from the end states and search backwards), and if the cat can force the game state enter a loop, cat wins. O(n^2m^2*l). We can further optimize the O(l) term using data structures.

remark. mouse may visit a place twice in the optimal solution.
