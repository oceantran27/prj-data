LeetCode

## Introduction
Here are *theoretical solutions* for some interesting LeetCode problems, aiming for the *best* running time. [The author](https://leetcode.cn/u/hqztrue/) is a TCS student who no longer frequently write codes, so if you are looking for *code implementations*... sorry, this might be the wrong place. There's one exception though: if an algorithm with good theoretical guarantee is also practical enough to *strictly* beat 100% of the submissions, I will consider to implement it. See [figs/](https://github.com/hqztrue/LeetCodeSolutions/blob/master/figs/) for a list of them.

p.s. If one doesn't like my coding style, he can use the following code formatting tools:

For most problems we consider here, the only thing we want to optimize is the running time. Randomization is usually allowed. Sometimes we will optimize on the space complexity as well. Lower bound will be provided, if the optimality of our algorithm is not obvious. If the main source of hardness of a problem is its coding complexity rather than the algorithm (e.g. simulation problems), we will skip the solution here.

### Notations
In some problems we will use the word-RAM model, where the assumption is each word has w bits and can store integers up to size W=2^w. In practice (i.e. 32-bit machines), w=32 and W=2^32. We assume the word length is w=\Omega(\log n), and the following basic word operations in the multiplicative instruction set can be executed in O(1): +, -, (*), &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>. By setting w'=\delta_0\log n for a sufficiently small constant \delta_0>0, we can simulate nonstandard word operations on w'-bit words in O(1) time by table lookup, with n^{O(\delta_0)}=o(n) preprocessing time. Theoretically speaking, you can always implement algorithms in the word-RAM model in codes.

For string, let |\Sigma| denote the alphabet size (i.e. |\Sigma|=26 for lowercase letters), and we usually assume |\Sigma| is much smaller than n. In some cases, we further make the (non-theory) assumption that |\Sigma|<=w (since 26<32). If the input is a set of strings, we will use L to denote the total length of them, and n is the number of strings. If the input is a single string, we use n to denote its length.

For trees, let h denote the height.

For graphs, let n denote the number of vertices and m denote the number of edges.

If the input is an n*m matrix, we sometimes use a single parameter n to denote max(n,m) for simplicity.

For space complexity, we use the definition which is in analogy to the following: for a TM with a (read-only) input tape, an output tape and work tapes, only the number of memory cells on work tapes counts. Here we assume the input is read-only, and for space complexity, we only count the number of memory cells on which we write. Note that this is different from the (relatively weaker) LeetCode definition, which usually allows in-place modifications to the memory cells containing the inputs. We call that definition "additional space complexity".

## Unsolved Problems
Here are a list of problems for which I don't know the current best algorithm. If a problem is open but the algorithm I provide here is (almost) the current best, it is viewed as "solved" and therefore not listed below. Some NP-hard problems are also not included.
