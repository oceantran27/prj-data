1. 2 Tries for prefix and suffix, for each node in the trie, store all strings with it as prefix/suffix. O(L) preprocessing, O(n) per query.
2. first for each string s, change it into s$s by connecting it with its copy by $. then connect all strings by # to get s_1$s_1#s_2$s_2#s_3$s_3... use suffix tree, for each query with prefix p and suffix q, search for q$p. in total O(L).
