this can be reduced to 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix, after sorting. O(sort(n))+O(n).

remark. when k=1, the problem can be solved in O(n) time, by reducing to the closest pair problem. More generally, when k is small, we can use the O(n+k) algorithm by selecting the k-th smallest element from an (implicit) heap \cite{frederickson1993optimal}.
