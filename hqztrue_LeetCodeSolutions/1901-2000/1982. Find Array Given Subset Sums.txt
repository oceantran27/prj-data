Let A denote the unknown array and S denote the set of subset sums. The minimum element m in S is the total sum of negative elements in A (we use \hat{A} to denote the set of negative elements). If we map each sum x\in S to x+m, we obtain a bijection between a subset T in A and a subset T\oplus \hat{A} in A', where A' contain all positive elements in A and the negation of all negative elements in A. Then we reduce to the case where all elements are nonnegative, and we can repeatedly find the smallest subset sum as the smallest element, and remove all subset sums that we already know. Finally find any subset in A' with sum m, and negate them. O(2^n).
