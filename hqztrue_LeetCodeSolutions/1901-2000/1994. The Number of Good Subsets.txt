Let n denote the universe size. DP on subsets of primes <=n. O(2^{O(n/log n)}*n).
We can further improve the running time to roughly 2^{O~(sqrt(n)/log n)}, since any prime >sqrt(n) can only be paired with primes that <=sqrt(n). For small constant n this approach simplifies to https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/the-number-of-good-subsets/solution/shu-xue-by-utoppia-ijm9/.
