1. for each character c, find its first and last occuring position l(c) and r(c). suppose the first and last character in the palindrome is c, we only need to count the number of distinct colors between l(c) and r(c). O(n+|Σ|^2 log n). the dependency on |Σ| is improvable to O(|Σ| polylog n), using colored range counting.
2. enumerate the middle character of the palindrome, and use & to find the common characters in the prefix and suffix. O(n|Σ|/w).
