The problem can be solved by a sliding window approach. We can prove that in the optimal solution, we always erase a "maximal" interval which contains unique elements. by "maximal" we mean, fix the left endpoint of the interval, we keep moving the right endpoint to the right, until the interval no longer contain unique elements. Then we can repeatedly move the left endpoint one step to the right, until the interval contains unique elements again. To check whether the current interval contain unique elements, we can use a hash table to maintain the elements within the interval. The running time is O(n).
