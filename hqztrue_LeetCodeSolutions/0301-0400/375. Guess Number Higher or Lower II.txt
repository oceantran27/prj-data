DP.
1. f[i][j] denote the result when the number is within [i,j]. f[i][j]=min_k max{f[i][k-1],f[k+1][j]}+k. O(n^3).
2. use monotone property to optimize. O(n^2).

remark. can we use a continuous function to approximate f(l,r) with low (additive) error? e.g. c*l*log(r-l).
Can we get O(n^2/2^{Omega(log n/log log n)}) running time, by performing dfs on the top few levels of the recursion tree, each node having branching factor O(polylog n)?
