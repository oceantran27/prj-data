// for this problem, we want to find the number of closed islands in the grid
// the closed islands are the islands that are surrounded by water from all sides
// or we can say that the closed islands are the islands that are not connected to any of the grid's borders

// we can use dfs to find the closed islands in the grid by checking if the current island is connected to any of the grid's borders
