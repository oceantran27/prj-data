        // to do that we use sliding window technique and we keep track of the last position of appearance of minK and maxK
        // to count the number of subarrays we use the following formula (min(mn, mx) - l + 1) where l is the left pointer of the sliding window
        // and mn and mx are the last positions of appearance of minK and maxK respectively
        // if the current element is less than minK or greater than maxK we reset the sliding window and mn and mx to -1
        // and we start the sliding window from the next element

        // imagine the following array [2, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 7] and minK = 1 and maxK = 5
        // by eye we can see that there are 6 subarrays that have a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 5
        // which are [2, 5, 3, 1], [2, 5, 3, 1, 2], [2, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4], [5, 3, 1], [5, 3, 1, 2], [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
        // to calculate the number of subarrays we use the following formula (min(mn, mx) - l + 1) while looping through the array
        // you find the first time the minK and the maxK appears together in the current window will be at position 3 (0-based indexing)
        // you can see that the number of subarrays at this position is 2 which can be calculated by (min(1, 3) - 0 + 1) = 2
        // then you find the second time the minK and the maxK appears together in the current window will be at position 4 (0-based indexing)
        // you can see that the number of subarrays at this position is 4 which have two subarrays that are already counted in the previous position
        // so you only have 2 new subarrays which can be calculated by (min(1, 4) - 0 + 1) = 2
        // and so on you find that the number of new subarrays can be calculated by (min(mn, mx) - l + 1) where l is the left pointer of the current sliding window
        // and if the current element is less than minK or greater than maxK you reset the sliding window and mn and mx to -1
        // because you cannot find new subarrays that have a minimum value of minK and a maximum value of maxK in the current window anymore

        // initialize the left pointer of the sliding window to 0, the last position of appearance of minK to -1, and the last position of appearance of maxK to -1

        // loop through the array
