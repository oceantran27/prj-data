// in this problem you need to find the number of operations to make the network connected
// the operation is to remove an edge from the network and reconnect it again between any other two nodes
// so you need to find if you have enough edges to connect all the nodes in the network
// if you have enough edges you can connect all the nodes in the network and the number of operations is the number of components - 1
// if you don't have enough edges you can't connect all the nodes in the network and the answer is -1

// we can use DSU to find the number of components in the network and count the number of edges in each component
// to connect all the nodes in a component you need at least the number of nodes in the component - 1 edges
// so the number of extra edges (that can be taken to connect any other two nodes) is the number of edges in each component - the number of nodes in each component + 1
// if the number of extra edges is greater than or equal to the number of components - 1 then you can connect all the nodes in the network
// and the number of operations is the number of components - 1
// otherwise you can't connect all the nodes in the network and the answer is -1
