/*
 Intuition:
    To know how many times that we will have to extract certain cables between two directly connected computers 
    and place them between any pair of disconnected computers, We will need to know two things:
    1- Is there enough cables to connect all the devices?
      We will know that by checking if we have cables more than or equal n - 1
      - If we have 4 computers we will need 3 cables. [o-o-o-o] -> 4 computers, 3 cables
    2- How many disconnected computers we need to connect?
      We will know that by using DFS to traverse through the graph
      and count how many connected components exist in our graph
