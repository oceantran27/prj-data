// if we have a number x, we can find the number of missing numbers before x by subtracting the index of x in the array from x
// if the number of missing numbers before x is less than or equal to k, then we can say that the kth missing number is in the range [x, 2x]
// so we can use binary search to find the number x that satisfies the condition (x - index of x in the array <= k) and we want to find the maximum x that satisfies this condition
// we can find the index of x in the array by using lower_bound function (it returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to x)

        // if the number of missing numbers before x is less than or equal to k

        // left: the maximum x that satisfies the condition (x - index of x in the array <= k)
        // right: the minimum x that satisfies the condition (x - index of x in the array > k)

        // if we are not sure about the minimum invalid x, we can set it to a large number 
        // but if this large number is too large, we may get a runtime error because of the overflow
        // so we can start with a small number and double it until we get a large enough number that is not valid (or valid depending on the problem)

        // start right with 1 to be able to double it
        int left = -1, right = 1;

        // double right until it is not valid (this loop will run at most log2(max_answer) times)
