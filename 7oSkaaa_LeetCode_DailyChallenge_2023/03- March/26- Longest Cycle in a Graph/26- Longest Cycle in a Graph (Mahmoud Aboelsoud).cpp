// to find the longest cycle in a graph
// we use topological sort to find if there is a cycle
// and we can only use depth to find the depth of entering a node
// and we can only use vis to find if a node is visited or not
// so we use 3 states for vis
// 0: not visited
// 1: visited but not finished
// 2: visited and finished

// we use dfs to find the longest cycle
// if we traversed a node before and it is not finished that means there is a cycle
// and we can find the length of the cycle by subtracting the depth of the node we are in now from the depth of the node we traversed before + 1
// and we can only use depth to find the depth of entering a node
