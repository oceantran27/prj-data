Problem

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).
For example, the numbers "69", "88", and "818" are all strobogrammatic.

Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.

For example,

Given n = 2, return ["11","69","88","96"].
