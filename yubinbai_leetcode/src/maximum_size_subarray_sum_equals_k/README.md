Problem
===

Given an array nums and a target value k, find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to k. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Example 1:
Given nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], k = 3,
return 4. (because the subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest)

Example 2:
Given nums = [-2, -1, 2, 1], k = 1,
return 2. (because the subarray [-1, 2] sums to 1 and is the longest)

Follow Up:
Can you do it in O(n) time?

Solution
===
bruteforce n^2, use a memoized greedy algorithm

1. to get the longest subarray matching a condition, the start_index is better be small
2. use hashmap to maintain achieved lengths and values
