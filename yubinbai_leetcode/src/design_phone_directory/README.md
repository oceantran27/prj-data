Problem
===
Design a Phone Directory which supports the following operations:

get: Provide a number which is not assigned to anyone.
check: Check if a number is available or not.
release: Recycle or release a number.
Example:

// Init a phone directory containing a total of 3 numbers: 0, 1, and 2.
PhoneDirectory directory = new PhoneDirectory(3);
// It can return any available phone number. Here we assume it returns 0.
directory.get();
// Assume it returns 1.
directory.get();
// The number 2 is available, so return true.
directory.check(2);
// It returns 2, the only number that is left.
directory.get();
// The number 2 is no longer available, so return false.
directory.check(2);
// Release number 2 back to the pool.
directory.release(2);
// Number 2 is available again, return true.
directory.check(2);


Solution
---

use a binary search tree, then each of the actions would take O(logN) time.

use a hash set and a queue, double the memory and each action would take O(1) time.
