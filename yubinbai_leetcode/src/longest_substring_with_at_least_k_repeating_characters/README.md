Problem
===

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 105

Solution
---

naive: for each starting point of substring, use a sliding window to maintain counter of chars
time: n^2

optimized: use an inversion of thinking. find the infrequent elements (show less than k times) as splits since any of these infrequent elements couldnâ€™t be any part of the substring we want. 
time: n*logn
