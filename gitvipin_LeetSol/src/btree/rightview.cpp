/*
Solution for : https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/
*/

/*
This problem can be solved in multiple ways. 

(1) Do a simple Level order traversal (using BFS),  Store the last element of every level. 
Time Complexity : O(n) , 
Space Complexity : O (n), You need to store all the nodes in between as you do not know 
which node will lead to right most node of next level. 

(2) Do a modified, Pre-Order traversal. In pre-order, traversal is Root->Left->right
We modify it to be Root->Right->Left and also keep a check of every level for which node (right most)
has already been added. Following solution is implmentation of this approach.
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(logn), At most you are traversing down one path on Binary tree. So max, logn nodes in stack
