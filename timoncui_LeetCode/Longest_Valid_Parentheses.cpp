Title: Longest Valid Parentheses

Description:
Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.
For "(()", the longest valid parentheses substring is "()", which has length = 2.
Another example is ")()())", where the longest valid parentheses substring is "()()", which has length = 4.

Difficulty rating: Hard

Notes:

Solution 1 (SolutionStack):

O(n) time and O(n) space.
With a stack, we keep track of the positions of all open left parentheses.
Each time a matching right parentheses appears, we pop the stack.
The longest valid string ending at current location
can extend to the left to: 
(a) position of the top of the stack + 1, if the stack is not empty.
For example, for s = "(()" when we get to i = 2.
or (b), min value of all previously matched left parentheses.
For example, for s = "()()" when we get to i = 3.
When the number of right parentheses exceeds the number of left,
we need to reset the counters and continue.

Solution 2:

O(n) time and O(1) space.
Scan from left to right, keep track of # left and # right. 
When they equal, we reach the end of a valid string.
When # right exceeds # left, reset the counters and continue.
This fails for cases such as s = "(()", but scan again from right to left fixes it.
The correctness is a little hard to prove (see below).

35 ms for 229 test cases in JudgeLarge.

Correctness:
Denote the longest valid string as v. 
If v is a suffix or prefix of s, obviously the method can find it.
Otherwise, s can only be of two forms: 
...)v... or
...(v(...
For the first case, when we reach the ')' before v, # right must have exceeded # left,
otherwise v can be extened further to the left, violating the assumption that v is longest.
So v would be a fresh start.
For the second case, similar argument would show that scanning from the right would make v
a fresh start from the right.
