# Testcase Example:  '121'
#
# Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when
# it reads the same backward as forward.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 121
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it
# becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: 10
# Output: false
# Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
# 
#
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False
        
        mirror = 0
        origin = x
        while x > 0:
            mirror = x % 10 + mirror * 10
            x = x // 10
            
        return mirror == origin
