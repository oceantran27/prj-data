/* Problem Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/ 

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

For example - 
m = 4, n = 4
4x4 matrix 
0 1 0 0 
1 1 0 0
0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1

Islands - 
|	1   |   1
| 1 1 | 1 1
|	1   |

There are 2 islands here first one which is having area 4
and second one whose area is 3
so we return max which is 4.
