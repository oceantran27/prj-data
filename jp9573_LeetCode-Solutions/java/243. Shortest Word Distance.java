/*
243. Shortest Word Distance
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1

Note: You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

Companies: Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Paypal and Uber

/*
Algorithm
It is enough to traverse the array once, initialize the two variables p1, p2 to -1, and then traverse the array.
When word 1 is encountered, its position is stored in p1, and if word 2 is encountered, its position is stored in p2. If p1, p2 are not -1 anymore, then update the result.
