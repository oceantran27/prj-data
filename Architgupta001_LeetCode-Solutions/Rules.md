> TAGS

* The Tags that could be labelled on your PR have the following meanings -
  - *hacktoberfest-accepted* - This is the tag you want 4 times to complete hacktoberfest.
  - *copied* - This tag defines that either you've copied the code or posted someone else's code. This could be publishing a website template by copying from third party websites.
  - *complete* - This tag will be labelled along with hacktoberfest-accepted tag.
  - *incomplete* - This tag gives a chance to rectify the PR in terms of correctness, completeness, is working code. This tag won't affect your hacktoberfest qualification.
