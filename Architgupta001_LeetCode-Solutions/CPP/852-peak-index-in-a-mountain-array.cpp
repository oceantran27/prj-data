/*  This problem is an applicaiton of binary search concept 

The mountain array is an array that contains first few elements in increasing order and then decreasing order
Ex - 1 4 5 3 2

NOTE - The solution template below is of that on leetcode side
To run on local machine you need to add header file (#include<bits/stdc++.h>) and create the main function
