***Important_property***
* a^a =0
* (a^b)^a = (a^a)^b = 0^b =b
* xor of even number of ele "a" is 0 
* xor of odd number of ele "a" is a itself
* i,e a^a^a^a^a = a

Idea is that when each element of nums1 mul with nums2 then there will be repetition or every ele of num1 exactly len(nums2) time,
So on basis of len(nums1), len(nums2) there are 4 condition:

if both len is even then result is 0 :
    every ele of both list will repeat even times

if nums1 is of odd len then and nums2 is even len then xor of nums1 is ans:
	every ele of nums1 will repeat even times and nums2' s odd times

if both are odd then result will xor of both list combined

class Solution:
    def xorAllNums(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        
        #Define a function that taken iterable and return xor of all ele       
        f=lambda x: reduce(xor,x)
        
        n1,n2=len(nums1), len(nums2)
        
        if n1%2==0 and n2%2!=0:
            return f(nums1)
        elif n2%2==0 and n1%2!=0:
            return f(nums2)
        elif n1%2==0 and n2%2==0:
            return 0
        
        return f(nums1)^f(nums2)
		
```

***one_liner***

```
		return (len(nums1) % 2 * reduce(xor, nums2)) ^ (len(nums2) % 2 * reduce(xor, nums1))
```
