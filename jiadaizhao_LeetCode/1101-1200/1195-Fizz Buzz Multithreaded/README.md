# 1195. Fizz Buzz Multithreaded

Difficulty: Medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz-multithreaded/

Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n, however:

* If the number is divisible by 3, output "fizz".
* If the number is divisible by 5, output "buzz".
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "fizzbuzz".

For example, for n = 15, we output: 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz.

Suppose you are given the following code:
```
class FizzBuzz {
  public FizzBuzz(int n) { ... }               // constructor
  public void fizz(printFizz) { ... }          // only output "fizz"
  public void buzz(printBuzz) { ... }          // only output "buzz"
  public void fizzbuzz(printFizzBuzz) { ... }  // only output "fizzbuzz"
  public void number(printNumber) { ... }      // only output the numbers
}
```
Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads. The same instance of FizzBuzz will be passed to four different threads:

1. Thread A will call fizz() to check for divisibility of 3 and outputs fizz.
2. Thread B will call buzz() to check for divisibility of 5 and outputs buzz.
3. Thread C will call fizzbuzz() to check for divisibility of 3 and 5 and outputs fizzbuzz.
4. Thread D will call number() which should only output the numbers.
