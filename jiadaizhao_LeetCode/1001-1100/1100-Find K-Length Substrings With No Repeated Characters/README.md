https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-length-substrings-with-no-repeated-characters/

Given a string S, return the number of substrings of length K with no repeated characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: S = "havefunonleetcode", K = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: 
There are 6 substrings they are : 'havef','avefu','vefun','efuno','etcod','tcode'.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: S = "home", K = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Notice K can be larger than the length of S. In this case is not possible to find any substring.
```

**Note:**
1. 1 <= S.length <= 10^4
2. All characters of S are lowercase English letters.
3. 1 <= K <= 10^4
