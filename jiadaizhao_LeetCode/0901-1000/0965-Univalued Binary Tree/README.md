A binary tree is univalued if every node in the tree has the same value.

Return true if and only if the given tree is univalued.

**Example 1:**  
![ex1](unival_bst_1.png)
```
Input: [1,1,1,1,1,null,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**  
![ex2](unival_bst_2.png)
```
Input: [2,2,2,5,2]
Output: false
```

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 100].
2. Each node's value will be an integer in the range [0, 99].
