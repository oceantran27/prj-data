## Fuck the leetcode.com

I find designing algorithm is a very cool thing. I have solved some problems which I did not know how to solve. And I have recognized that implementing effectively is very very important.

[NOTES.md](https://github.com/hex108/leetcode/blob/master/NOTES.md) is my notes.

## About

`./generate.sh your_program_name`

It will generate a directory named 'your\_program\_name' and some files in it using the template in directory 'template'.

### Where is questions
I have saved questions to 'Leetcode.html'. You could also visit [Leetcode](http://www.leetcode.com).
