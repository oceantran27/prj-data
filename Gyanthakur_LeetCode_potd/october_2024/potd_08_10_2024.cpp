// 1963. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced

/*
Problem Description:
You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2 closing brackets ']'.

A string is called balanced if and only if:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.
You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "][]["
Output: 1
Explanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
The resulting string is "[[]]".
Example 2:

Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".
Example 3:

Input: s = "[]"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already balanced.

class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        int closed = 0, opened = 0, swaps = 0;

        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '[') {
                opened += 1; // Count opened brackets
            } else {
                closed += 1; // Count closed brackets

                // If there are more closed brackets than opened
                if (closed > opened) {
                    swaps += 1; // Increment swaps needed
                    closed -= 1; // Adjust counts
                    opened += 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return swaps; // Return the number of swaps needed
    }
