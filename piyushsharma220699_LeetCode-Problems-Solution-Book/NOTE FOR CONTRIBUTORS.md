# GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTORS

## Follow the following steps to contribute

1. Search for the code you want to contribute in the repository first.
2. If it doesn't exist, check the issues list. If in the existing issues list the problem is present, check if it's already assigned to someone or not.
3. If it's not assigned, comment on the issue along with the language you want to work on.
4. If the problem is not present in the existing issues, create a new issue. Don't forget to mention the language you want to work on.
5. WAIT PATIENTLY FOR THE ISSUE TO BE ASSIGNED TO YOU!
6. Create a new branch in your forked repository and start working on your code.
7. After you're done with the code, update the README.md file you find in that folder in order of <b>LEETCODE PROBLEM NUMBER</b> (Make sure you don't change the README.md in root of project but the README.md in folder of language you're working.)<br><br>
Add "Problem Number" + " : " + "Problem Name" in README.md<br>
Eg: 1 : Add Sum <br>
8. You've done your job. Now wait for it to get reviewed and approved by maintainers :)

## MUST READ NOTES FOR THE CONTRIBUTOR
1. You cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you. Issues will be assigned on a FIRST COME FIRST SERVE (FCFS) basis. The person who creates the issue gets the first priority. And then, issues are assigned based on who commented first. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned and the programming language you are going to use, and it will be done if found fit.
2. Don't forget to add the following things to your code (The PR will not get accepted if these are not present) -
    A. Proper comments wherever necessary.<br>
    B. A block comment at the start of the code containing the problem number, problem name and problem statement.<br>
    C. After the code, a block comment having sample input, sample output, time complexity of the solution and space complexity of the solution.<br>
3. All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and then create a PR.<br>
4. PLEASE DO NOT COPY THE CODE, PLAGIARIZED PR's WILL NOT GET ACCEPTED AT ALL!
