Code is broken into 2 parts :
1. Create binary tree for each testcase.
2. Print all the left child elements in binary tree.

Detail description :
1. Create binary tree for each testcase :
      #1 - first input is number of testcases.
      #2 - Enter the size of  array.
      #3 - Enter the elements in array if input value is 0 then it means particular node is NULL.

2. Print all the left child elements of binary tree :
     #1 - using queue 
     #2 - Time complexity : O(n)
     #3 - Space complexity : O(n)
