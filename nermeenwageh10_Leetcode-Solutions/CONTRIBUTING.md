## Contributing Guidelines
Follow these guidelines to contribute to this repository of Leetcode questions and solutions:

1. **Match the casing of files and directories.**
2. **Title your PR accurately and succinctly** (e.g., _"Create: 1-Two-Sum.py"_).
3. **Ensure your code passes** the submission on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com) for the problem it solves.
4. **Write clean, easy-to-understand code** by using meaningful variable/method names, maintaining a consistent style, etc. Avoid using single letters as variable names, as they lack semantic meaning.
5. **Check if the problem is already solved** in the language you're contributing in.

## Problem Levels and Adding Solutions
For each problem level, follow these steps to add your solution:

- If the table already has a column for your language, just link your solution and ensure the problem hasn't been solved already.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:** What if there are multiple ways to solve the problem?

**A:** Choose the best solution based on time and memory complexity.   
If there are multiple optimal solutions, you can either choose one, or add all solutions in the same file, keeping **only one solution <u>uncommented</u>**. Please include a comment above each solution describing the approach technique/algorithm (e.g., two pointers, HashMap, BFS, etc.).
