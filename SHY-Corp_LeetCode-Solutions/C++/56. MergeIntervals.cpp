/*
 * Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
 * Output: [[1,5]]
 * Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

 /*
  * In this, we are first sorting the intervals as these are not in sorted order.
  * We are taking the first interval out and keeping its value in lower and upper variable (and denoting this interval as previous interval)
  * , so that we can use it to compare next preceding intervals.   
  * For each consecutive intervals, we will check if the starting of the current interval is smaller than the end of the previous interval and the end value
  * of the previous interval smaller than the end value of the current interval. Then, we will update the end value of the previous interval with current interval. 
  * If the end of the previous is smaller then the start of the current, then we insert the previous value and update the current interval's value
  * with previous one i.e current interval value will become the lower and upper.
