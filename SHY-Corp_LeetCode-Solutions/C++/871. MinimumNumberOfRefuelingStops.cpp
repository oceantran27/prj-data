// A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.
//
// Along the way, there are gas stations.  Each station[i] represents a gas station that is station[i][0] miles east of the starting position, and has station[i][1] liters of gas.
//
// The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.
// 
// When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.
//
// What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination?  If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.
//
// Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.  If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.
