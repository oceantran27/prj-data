        Problem #1283 "Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold"
        Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-smallest-divisor-given-a-threshold/
        Given an array of integers nums and an integer threshold, we will choose a positive integer divisor and               divide all the array by it and sum the result of the division. Find the smallest divisor such that the result         mentioned above is less than or equal to threshold.

        Each result of division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For                 example: 7/3 = 3 and 10/2 = 5).
        Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
        Output: 5
        Explanation: We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1. 
        If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum to 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2).
