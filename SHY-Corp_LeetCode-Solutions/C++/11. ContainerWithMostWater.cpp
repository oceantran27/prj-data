/*

Problem : Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Approach : 
	Start with pointer left=0 and pointer right=length-1
	The max water is limited by the pointer with smaller height
	when moving a pointer, the width of the area decrease
	If we move the pointer with higher height, we will never get a greater area, the max height will be at most the one of the pointer with smaller height.
	So we need to move the pointer with smaller height to have a chance to get higher height at the next
