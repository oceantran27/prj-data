// Problem - 887. Super Egg Drop

/*
Problem statement -
You are given K eggs, and you have access to a building with N floors from 1 to N. 
Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.
You know that there exists a floor F with 0 <= F <= N such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than F will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor F will not break.
Each move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor X (with 1 <= X <= N). 
Your goal is to know with certainty what the value of F is.
What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what F is, regardless of the initial value of F?
*/

/*
Constraints - 
1. 1 <= K <= 100
2. 1 <= N <= 10000
*/

/*
Example 1:
Input: K = 1, N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Drop the egg from floor 1.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 1.
If it didn't break, then we know with certainty F = 2.
Hence, we needed 2 moves in the worst case to know what F is with certainty.

Example 2:
Input: K = 2, N = 6
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: K = 3, N = 14
Output: 4

//Solution
/*
Idea -
Drop eggs is a very classical problem.
Some people may come up with idea O(KN^2)
where dp[K][N] = 1 + max(dp[K - 1][i - 1], dp[K][N - i]) for i in 1...N.
However this idea is very brute force, for the reason that you check all possiblity.

So I consider this problem in a different way:
dp[M][K]means that, given K eggs and M moves,
what is the maximum number of floor that we can check.

The dp equation is:
dp[m][k] = dp[m - 1][k - 1] + dp[m - 1][k] + 1,
which means we take 1 move to a floor,
if egg breaks, then we can check dp[m - 1][k - 1] floors.
if egg doesn't breaks, then we can check dp[m - 1][k] floors.

dp[m][k] is the number of combinations and it increase exponentially to N


Complexity
For time, O(NK) decalre the space, O(KlogN) running,
For space, O(NK).
