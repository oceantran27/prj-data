/** This is very interesting DP problem which requires some observation
 *  So the problem says that we want to maximize the team score such that there is no conflict.
 *  Conflict only occurs if we select a player which has strictly higher score but strictly less age than another player.
 *  If you try to hand run some random test cases, then you may observe the following things:
 *      1. We need to sort the given data first by age then by score.
 *      2. Now after sorting we only need to find the maximum sum increasing subsequence (MSIS) from the given data, which is classical DP problem.
 *  In the code I have first made vector of pairs to sort the data. Then I have applied DP to get MSIS.
 *  For MSIS tutorial : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-sum-increasing-subsequence-dp-14/
