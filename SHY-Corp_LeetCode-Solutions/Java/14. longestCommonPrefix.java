/* Question:
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

0 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lower-case English letters.   */

//Solution
//The idea is to apply binary search method to find the string with maximum value L, 
//which is common prefix of all of the strings. The algorithm searches space is the interval (0â€¦minLen), 
//where minLen is minimum string length and the maximum possible common prefix. 
//Each time search space is divided in two equal parts, one of them is discarded,because it is sure that it doesn't contain the solution. There are two possible cases:
//(A) S[1...mid] is not a common string. This means that for each j > i S[1..j] is not a common string and we discard the second half of the search space.
//(B) S[1...mid] is common string. This means that for for each i < j S[1..i] is a common string and we discard the first half of the search space, because we try to find longer common prefix.
class Solution {
   public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
    if (strs == null || strs.length == 0)
        return "";
    int minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for (String str : strs)
        minLen = Math.min(minLen, str.length());
    int low = 1;
    int high = minLen;
    while (low <= high) {
        int middle = (low + high) / 2;
        if (isCommonPrefix(strs, middle))
            low = middle + 1;
        else
            high = middle - 1;
    }
    return strs[0].substring(0, (low + high) / 2);
}

private boolean isCommonPrefix(String[] strs, int len){
    String str1 = strs[0].substring(0,len);
    for (int i = 1; i < strs.length; i++)
        if (!strs[i].startsWith(str1))
            return false;
    return true;
}
}
