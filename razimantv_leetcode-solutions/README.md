## Footnote
* All are AC solutions
* Very few will have comments, because I wrote them for myself, often during contests. But raise an issue if you want to understand more about a solution, and I will add an explanation
* There is a small chance that a handful of solutions are not mine, because I sometimes submit solutions that my students ask me to debug. Raise an issue and I will remove it
