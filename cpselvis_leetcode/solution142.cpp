/**
 * Linked List Cycle II
 * This question is based on math theroy describe as flollows:
 * Suppose circumference is r, the whole linked list length is l, from  beginning to cycle node is a and cycle node to encounter node is x, when fast and slow node meet, fast has run 2s, slow is s, then we have expression:
 *   2s = s + n * r
 *      => s = n * r
 *   a + x = n * r
 *   r = l - a
 *     => a + x = (n - 1) * r + r
 *     => a = (n - 1) * r + r - x
 *     => a = (n - 1) * r + l - a - x
 * Due to analysis, we have conclusion: if two pointer is from head and encounter and if they run by same speed, they will meet at cycle point.
